## Success Metrics (First 30 Days)

Track these metrics in YouTube Analytics:

- [ ] **Views**: Target 1,000+ (conservative)
- [ ] **Watch Time**: Target 40%+ average view duration
- [ ] **Engagement**: Target 50+ likes, 10+ comments
- [ ] **CTR**: Target 4%+ (thumbnail click-through rate)
- [ ] **Traffic Sources**:
  - [ ] YouTube search: 30-40%
  - [ ] External (Reddit, etc.): 30-40%
  - [ ] Suggested videos: 20-30%
- [ ] **Subscribers**: Target 20-50 new subscribers

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: Audio quality poor
- **Solution**: Use USB microphone (Blue Yeti), record in quiet room

**Issue**: Demo fails during recording
- **Solution**: Cut to pre-recorded successful demo, narrate over it

**Issue**: Video file too large (YouTube limit: 256GB)
- **Solution**: Compress with Handbrake (H.264, CRF 23)

**Issue**: Low view count in first week
- **Solution**: Cross-post to Reddit, Dev.to, Hacker News (wait 24-48 hours first)

**Issue**: High drop-off rate at specific timestamp
- **Solution**: Note for re-edit in Phase 2 (series split)

---

## Phase 2 Planning (Weeks 5-8)

**After 30 days, evaluate metrics:**

**If successful** (1,000+ views, 40%+ retention):
- [ ] Plan series split (10-15 videos)
- [ ] Use retention data to optimize splits
- [ ] Re-edit into series format

**If metrics below target**:
- [ ] Analyze drop-off points
- [ ] Gather user feedback
- [ ] Consider shorter intro video (5-10 min)
- [ ] Improve SEO (title, description, tags)
