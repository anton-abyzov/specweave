## 🔑 Key Changes

### 1. Constitution → Principles (docs/principles.md)

**Before**: Rigid "Articles" like legal document
**After**: Flexible best practices, configurable per project

**Example**:
```yaml
# .specweave/config.yaml
principles:
  enforce_specs_as_truth: true
  test_first_development: true
  context_precision: true

  custom_principles:
    - "All APIs must have OpenAPI 3.0 specs"
    - "No direct DB queries in controllers"
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Not conflicting with agent instructions
- ✅ Adaptable to project needs
- ✅ Configurable enforcement levels
- ✅ Can have exceptions with justification

### 2. ADRs → docs/decisions/

**Before**: `adrs/` separate from docs
**After**: `docs/decisions/` integrated with documentation

**Why**: ADRs ARE documentation, should be discoverable with other docs.

### 3. Skills Source of Truth: src/skills/

**Before**: `.claude/skills/` (confusing - is this source or generated?)
**After**:
```
src/skills/              # SOURCE (in repo, version controlled)
  ├── feature-planner/
  └── specweave-detector/

Installation:
  npx specweave install --local   → .claude/skills/
  npx specweave install --global  → ~/.claude/skills/
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Clear source of truth
- ✅ Install local (project-specific) or global (all projects)
- ✅ Similar to npm (source in repo, installed to node_modules)

### 4. specweave-detector Skill (Entry Point)

**File**: `src/skills/specweave-detector/SKILL.md`

**Purpose**: **Factory of agents** that auto-activates when `.specweave/` exists

**How It Works**:
```
User opens project with .specweave/
    ↓
specweave-detector activates (proactive: true)
    ↓
User: "I want to add payments"
    ↓
specweave-detector:
  - Parses intent: ADD + FEATURE + PAYMENTS
  - Routes to: feature-planner
    ↓
feature-planner creates: 002-payment-processing/
    ↓
User: "Implement it"
    ↓
specweave-detector orchestrates:
  1. context-loader (load specs)
  2. developer (implement)
  3. qa-engineer (tests)
  4. docs-updater (update docs)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No manual `@role` selection needed
- ✅ Intelligent intent parsing
- ✅ Nested skill orchestration
- ✅ Seamless user experience

**User Experience**:
```
# User doesn't need to know about skills
User: "Add Stripe integration"

# SpecWeave handles everything:
✅ Feature 003 created: 003-stripe-integration
✅ Context loaded: specs/modules/payments/stripe/
✅ Code implemented: src/payments/stripe-service.ts
✅ Tests generated: tests/payments/stripe.test.ts
✅ Docs updated: docs/reference/api.md
```

### 5. Roadmap (features/roadmap.md)

**Purpose**: Project visibility - see what's being worked on

**Features**:
- Shows current version and next release
- Lists all features by status (in progress, planned, completed)
- Displays completion percentage
- Links to feature directories
- Auto-generated from `features/` status

**Integration**:
```bash
# Sync to GitHub Issues
specweave sync github --export

# Sync to JIRA
specweave sync jira --export

# Sync to Trello
specweave sync trello --export
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Answer: "What features are you working on?"
- ✅ Traceability: changes → features
- ✅ Public roadmap for open source
- ✅ Integration with project management tools

### 6. GitHub Best Practices

**Created**:
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - CI/CD for tests, validation
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` - Bug reports, feature requests
- Branch protection rules (to be configured)

**CI/CD Features**:
- ✅ Tests on push/PR
- ✅ Multi-platform (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
- ✅ Multi-node version (18.x, 20.x)
- ✅ Skill validation (check 3+ tests exist)
- ✅ Structure validation (required directories)
- ✅ Code coverage (Codecov integration)

**Git Flow**:
```
main       ──────●────────●──────●──────  (releases: v0.1.0, v0.2.0)
             ╱       ╲        ╱      ╲
develop  ───●─────●───●────●────────●──  (integration)
           ╱     ╱      ╲    ╲
feature/001  ╱      feature/002  ╲
           ╱                       ╲
```

### 7. MkDocs Documentation Portal (mkdocs.yml)

**Purpose**: Beautiful, searchable documentation website

**Features**:
- Material theme (light/dark mode)
- Auto-generated from `docs/`
- Deployed to GitHub Pages
- Search functionality
- Mermaid diagrams support
- Code syntax highlighting

**URL**: `https://yourusername.github.io/specweave`

**Deployment**:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/docs.yml (to be created)
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

## 🚀 Extensibility Examples (Your Use Cases)

### 1. New Relic Monitoring

**Create**: `src/skills/newrelic-monitor/SKILL.md`

```yaml
---
name: newrelic-monitor
description: Integrates New Relic monitoring. Generates instrumentation, dashboards, alerts. Activates for: new relic, monitoring, APM.
references:
  - https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/
scripts:
  - scripts/generate-instrumentation.js
  - scripts/create-dashboard.js
---
```

**Usage**:
```
User: "Add New Relic monitoring to my app"
    ↓
specweave-detector: Route to newrelic-monitor
    ↓
newrelic-monitor:
  - Reads specs (SLAs, endpoints)
  - Generates instrumentation code
  - Creates dashboards
  - Sets up alerts
```

### 2. CQRS Implementation

**Create**: `src/skills/cqrs-implementer/SKILL.md`

```yaml
---
name: cqrs-implementer
description: Implements CQRS patterns. Supports 1-DB or 2-DB approach. Configurable via specs. Activates for: CQRS, command query, event sourcing.
references:
  - docs/architecture/cqrs-approach.md  # Your rules: 1 DB, separate models
---
```

**Your Custom Rules** (in `docs/architecture/cqrs-approach.md`):
```markdown
# CQRS Approach

**Decision**: Use 1 database with separate read/write models

**Rationale**:
- Simpler operations (no eventual consistency complexity)
- Sufficient for our scale (10k concurrent users)
- Can scale to 2 DBs later if needed

**Implementation**:
- Write Model: Domain entities with business logic
- Read Model: Denormalized views optimized for queries
- Synchronization: Same transaction, no lag
```

**Usage**:
```
User: "Implement CQRS for user management"
    ↓
cqrs-implementer:
  - Reads docs/architecture/cqrs-approach.md
  - Generates Write Model (User aggregate)
  - Generates Read Model (UserView)
  - Creates command handlers
  - Creates query handlers
  - Uses 1 DB (as specified in YOUR docs)
```

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture

**Create**: `src/skills/eda-architect/SKILL.md`

```yaml
---
name: eda-architect
description: Designs Event-Driven Architecture. Supports Kafka, RabbitMQ, EventBridge. Activates for: event driven, EDA, events, messaging.
references:
  - docs/architecture/event-driven-design.md
  - specs/modules/events/
scripts:
  - scripts/generate-event-schema.js
  - scripts/create-kafka-topics.js
---
```

**Power**:
- Reads your event specs
- Generates Avro/Protobuf schemas
- Creates Kafka topics with YOUR retention/partition config
- Implements producers/consumers following YOUR patterns

---

## 📊 Claude Skills Status

**Your Question**: "Are Claude skills only in preview?"

**Answer**: **No, Claude Code skills are Generally Available (GA)**

From [anthropic.com/news/skills](https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills):
- ✅ Available now in Claude Code
- ✅ Same format across Claude.ai, Claude Code, and API
- ✅ Skills marketplace at [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)

**This means**: SpecWeave skills work for everyone using Claude Code today!

---

## 🎓 How SpecWeave Works Now

### Automatic Activation

```
1. User opens project
2. Claude Code detects .specweave/config.yaml
3. specweave-detector activates (proactive: true)
4. SpecWeave mode active (user doesn't need to know)
```

### Intent Parsing & Routing

```
User: "I want to add payment processing"
    ↓
specweave-detector:
  - Parse: ADD + FEATURE + PAYMENT
  - Intent: feature_creation
  - Route to: feature-planner
    ↓
feature-planner: Create 002-payment-processing/
    ↓
User: "Implement it"
    ↓
specweave-detector:
  - Parse: IMPLEMENT
  - Detect active feature: 002
  - Orchestrate nested skills:
      1. context-loader: Load specs/modules/payments/**
      2. developer: Implement code
      3. qa-engineer: Generate tests
      4. docs-updater: Update docs
```

### Context Precision

```
features/002-payment-processing/context-manifest.yaml:
---
spec_sections:
  - specs/modules/payments/**/*.md
  - specs/modules/shared/entities.md#payment-models
architecture:
  - architecture/data/payment-schema.md
adrs:
  - docs/decisions/006-payment-provider.md
max_context_tokens: 10000
---

Result: Only 10k tokens loaded, not 100k from full specs!
```

---

## 🔧 Installation Mechanism

### Source vs Installed

```
# Source of truth (in repo)
src/skills/feature-planner/

# Installation
npx specweave install feature-planner --local
# Copies to: .claude/skills/feature-planner/

npx specweave install feature-planner --global
# Copies to: ~/.claude/skills/feature-planner/
```

**Why**:
- ✅ Source code versioned in repo
- ✅ Clear what's source vs generated
- ✅ Can install local (project-specific) or global (all projects)
- ✅ Similar to npm ecosystem

---

## 📈 Project Tracking & Visibility

### Problem Solved

**Before** (SpecKit, BMAD):
- Unknown what features are being worked on
- No public roadmap
- Can't trace changes → features

**After** (SpecWeave):
- `features/roadmap.md` shows all features by status
- Sync with JIRA/GitHub/Trello/ADO
- Every commit linked to feature
- Public visibility for open source

**Example**:
```markdown
# features/roadmap.md

## In Progress
- 001-context-loader (30% complete) - Due: Feb 15

## Planned for v0.2.0
- 002-skill-router
- 003-docs-updater

## Completed
- (None yet)
```

**GitHub Integration**:
```bash
specweave sync github --export
# Creates GitHub issues from features
# Syncs status bidirectionally
# Links commits to features
```
