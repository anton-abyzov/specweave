description: |
  Test that the ML pipeline correctly handles and reports data quality issues.
  Validates that pipeline fails fast with clear error messages instead of
  training on bad data.

scenario:
  use_case: Data Quality Assurance
  problem: Corrupted or malformed training data
  expected_behavior: Pipeline stops with clear error message

test_cases:
  - name: Missing annotations
    corrupt_data: Remove annotation files
    expected_error: "Missing annotation files for [frame_001.jpg, ...]"

  - name: Invalid YOLO format
    corrupt_data: Write invalid annotation (negative coordinates)
    expected_error: "Invalid bounding box coordinates in [frame_002.txt]"

  - name: Inconsistent dimensions
    corrupt_data: Mix different image resolutions
    expected_warning: "Inconsistent image dimensions detected"

  - name: Empty dataset
    corrupt_data: No images in train folder
    expected_error: "No training images found in dataset"

test_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Create corrupted dataset (missing annotations)
    expected: Dataset created with intentional issues

  - step: 2
    action: Run data validation stage
    expected: Validation detects errors

  - step: 3
    action: Verify pipeline stops before training
    expected: Training stage not executed

  - step: 4
    action: Check error message quality
    expected: Clear, actionable error message

success_criteria:
  - Pipeline detects data issues
  - Training does not start with bad data
  - Error messages are clear and actionable
  - Pipeline state is recoverable
