# Random Ideas & Brainstorming

Just dumping thoughts here...

## Product Ideas
- Maybe add dark mode?
- Could use WebSockets for real-time updates
- Mobile app would be nice
- AI-powered recommendations?

## Technical Improvements
- Migrate to microservices (or not?)
- Try out that new framework everyone's talking about
- Better caching strategy
- GraphQL instead of REST?

## Process Improvements
- Daily standups feel too long
- Should we use Notion or Confluence?
- JIRA is annoying, maybe try Linear?

## Miscellaneous
- Company retreat ideas
- Tech conference to attend
- Blog post topics
- Lunch recommendations near office

## Follow-up
Most of these are just thoughts. Nothing concrete yet. Will revisit later maybe.
