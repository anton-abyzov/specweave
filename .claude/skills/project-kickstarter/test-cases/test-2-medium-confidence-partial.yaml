  I want to build a task management system with real-time collaboration.
  Tech stack: React and Node.js

expected_signals:
  project_name: task management system
  features_count: 1 # only "real-time collaboration" mentioned
  tech_stack_mentioned: true
  timeline_mentioned: false
  problem_statement: false
  business_model: false

expected_confidence: medium
expected_adjusted_confidence: 83% # 3 signals + 2 SpecWeave bonus = 5/6
expected_action: auto_route_to_increment_planning # still high enough with bonus
expected_command: /specweave.inc

assistant_should:
  - Recognize the intent to build something
  - Note the tech stack is clear
  - May ask 1-2 clarifying questions about features/timeline
  - Route to /specweave.inc or spec-driven-brainstorming

assistant_should_not:
  - Treat as general conversation
  - Ask excessive clarifying questions (max 1-2)
  - Wait for explicit command
