## Gap Analysis Workflow (Dynamic)

When you request gap analysis, I will:

### Step 1: Analyze Current SpecWeave State

**I will read and analyze:**
```bash
# Project structure
- CLAUDE.md (complete guide)
- features/ (implemented features)
- src/skills/ (available skills)
- specifications/ (spec organization)
- .specweave/docs/ (documentation structure)

# Features and capabilities
- What features exist in features/
- What skills exist in src/skills/
- What's documented in .specweave/docs/
- What's planned in roadmap
```

### Step 2: Compare to BMAD (Static Knowledge)

**I will compare:**
- Workflow approach (continuous vs two-phase)
- Role/skill systems (auto-routing vs explicit)
- QA capabilities (testing vs quality gates)
- Documentation structure (modular specs vs PRD/arch)
- Context management (manifests vs always-loaded)
- Brownfield support (analyzer vs documentation)

### Step 3: Generate Gap Analysis Report

**Report includes:**

**A. What BMAD Has That SpecWeave Lacks**
- Features present in BMAD
- Not implemented in SpecWeave
- Priority assessment (critical, nice-to-have)
- Implementation difficulty

**B. What SpecWeave Has That BMAD Lacks**
- Features present in SpecWeave
- Not in BMAD
- Unique benefits
- Why it matters

**C. Different Approaches (Not Gaps)**
- Features both have, implemented differently
- Trade-offs
- Use case suitability

**D. Recommendations**
- Which framework for which use case
- Hybrid approaches
- Adoption strategy

### Step 4: Answer Your Specific Question

Based on analysis, provide:
- Direct answer to your question
- Supporting evidence from both frameworks
- Concrete examples
- Actionable recommendations

## Example Interactions

### Example 1: General Gap Analysis

**User**: "Compare SpecWeave to BMAD - what are the gaps?"

**I will**:
1. Read current SpecWeave state:
   ```bash
   - Check features/ for implemented capabilities
   - Read src/skills/ for available skills
   - Review CLAUDE.md for documented features
   - Settings auto-detected for configuration
   ```

2. Compare to BMAD knowledge:
   - QA workflow (BMAD has *risk, *gate, etc.)
   - Agent system (BMAD has explicit @commands)
   - Templates (BMAD has YAML templates)
   - Expansion packs (BMAD has domain extensions)

3. Generate report:
   ```markdown
   # Gap Analysis: BMAD vs SpecWeave

   ## Analysis Date: [current date]
   ## SpecWeave Version: [from config or git]
   ## BMAD Version: 1.x (latest from GitHub)

   ### Gaps: BMAD Features Missing in SpecWeave

   1. **Quality Gates (@qa *gate)**
      - Status: Not implemented in SpecWeave
      - BMAD has: Formal PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL decisions
      - Impact: Medium-High (formal quality control)
      - Recommendation: Implement as qa-gate skill (P2 priority)

   2. **Risk Scoring (@qa *risk)**
      - Status: Not implemented in SpecWeave
      - BMAD has: Probability √ó Impact scoring (1-9 scale)
      - Impact: Medium (structured risk assessment)
      - Recommendation: Add to qa-engineer skill

   [... continue for all gaps ...]

   ### Benefits: SpecWeave Features Not in BMAD

   1. **Context Manifests (70%+ token reduction)**
      - Status: Core SpecWeave feature
      - BMAD has: Always-loaded files only
      - Benefit: Dramatic token savings, scales to enterprise
      - Why it matters: Cost reduction, faster responses

   [... continue ...]

   ### Recommendations

   - Use BMAD if: [specific use cases]
   - Use SpecWeave if: [specific use cases]
   - Hybrid approach: [if applicable]
   ```

### Example 2: Specific Feature Question

**User**: "How does BMAD handle quality assurance?"

**I will**:
1. Explain BMAD QA workflow (static knowledge)
2. Show @qa commands and examples
3. Compare to SpecWeave approach (read qa-engineer skill if exists)
4. Highlight differences

**Response**:
```markdown
# BMAD Quality Assurance Workflow

## BMAD Approach

BMAD has a comprehensive QA workflow via @qa agent with 6 commands:

1. **@qa *risk** - Risk Assessment
   - Scores risks: Probability (1-3) √ó Impact (1-3) = Total (1-9)
   - Categories: Technical, Business, Security
   - Output: Risk assessment document
   - Example: High-risk story (P:3 √ó I:3 = 9) gets extra scrutiny

2. **@qa *design** - Test Architecture
   - Creates test strategy
   - Defines test levels (unit, integration, E2E)
   - Documents test approach
   - Output: Test design document

[... explain all 6 commands ...]

## SpecWeave Approach (Current State)

[Read and analyze src/skills/qa-engineer/ if exists]

- qa-engineer skill: [describe what it does]
- playwright-tester skill: [E2E testing]
- Missing: Quality gates, risk scoring
- Strength: Mandatory E2E tests, truth-telling tests

## Comparison

| Aspect | BMAD | SpecWeave |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Risk Assessment | ‚úÖ Structured scoring | ‚ùå Not implemented |
| Quality Gates | ‚úÖ Explicit decisions | ‚ùå Not implemented |
| Test Strategy | ‚úÖ @qa *design | ‚úÖ tests.md in features |
| E2E Testing | Manual via @dev | ‚úÖ Mandatory (playwright-tester) |
| Traceability | ‚úÖ @qa *trace | ‚ö†Ô∏è Via context manifests |

## Recommendation

- **If you need formal QA gates**: Use BMAD or implement in SpecWeave
- **If you prioritize E2E validation**: SpecWeave has this built-in
- **Hybrid**: Use BMAD QA workflow + SpecWeave E2E tests
```

### Example 3: Decision Support

**User**: "Should I use BMAD or SpecWeave for a legacy Java enterprise app?"

**I will**:
1. Analyze use case requirements
2. Check SpecWeave brownfield capabilities (read brownfield-analyzer skill)
3. Compare to BMAD brownfield approach
4. Provide specific recommendation

**Response**:
```markdown
# Framework Recommendation: Legacy Java Enterprise App

## Use Case Analysis

**Project Characteristics:**
- ‚úÖ Existing codebase (brownfield)
- ‚úÖ Enterprise scale
- ‚úÖ Likely large (100k+ lines)
- ‚úÖ Java ecosystem
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Legacy = likely poor documentation

## BMAD Approach

**Strengths:**
- Clear planning phase (document architecture first)
- Explicit agent commands (control over process)
- QA risk assessment (identify high-risk modifications)

**Challenges:**
- No dedicated brownfield analyzer
- Manual documentation of existing system
- Two environments (web + IDE)

## SpecWeave Approach (Current State)

[Read and analyze brownfield-analyzer skill if exists]

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ brownfield-analyzer skill (automated analysis)
- ‚úÖ Retroactive specification generation
- ‚úÖ Mandatory regression tests before modification
- ‚úÖ Context manifests (handle large codebase efficiently)
- ‚úÖ Single environment (IDE only)

**Challenges:**
- Missing: Formal risk scoring
- Missing: Quality gates

## Recommendation

**üéØ Use SpecWeave for this use case**

**Reasons:**
1. **Brownfield-ready**: Dedicated analyzer and regression prevention
2. **Scale**: Context manifests handle 100k+ line codebases
3. **Safety**: Mandatory tests before modification
4. **Efficiency**: 70%+ token reduction critical for large codebase

**Augment with BMAD concepts:**
- Use @qa *risk mindset for manual risk assessment
- Implement quality gate checkpoints before major releases

**Implementation Path:**
1. `specweave init --brownfield`
2. Run brownfield-analyzer on Java codebase
3. Generate retroactive specs
4. Create regression tests (JUnit + E2E)
5. Proceed with safe modifications
```
