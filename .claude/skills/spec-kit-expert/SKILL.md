## SPEC-KIT Knowledge Base (Static Reference)

### What is spec-kit?

**spec-kit** is an open-source toolkit enabling "spec-driven development" where specifications become executable artifacts that directly generate working implementations.

**Repository**: https://github.com/github/spec-kit
**Stars**: 42.1K+ (highly popular)
**License**: MIT
**Creator**: GitHub (official GitHub project)

**Philosophy**: "An open source toolkit that allows you to focus on product scenarios and predictable outcomes instead of vibe coding every piece from scratch."

### Core spec-kit Concepts

#### 1. Directory Structure

**spec-kit uses `.specify/` directory** (different from SpecWeave's `.specweave/`):

```
.specify/
├── memory/
│   └── constitution.md          # Project principles & guidelines
├── scripts/
│   ├── check-prerequisites.sh
│   ├── common.sh
│   ├── create-new-feature.sh
│   ├── setup-plan.sh
│   └── update-claude-md.sh
├── specs/
│   └── [FEATURE-NUMBER]-[NAME]/
│       ├── spec.md              # Functional requirements (WHAT, WHY)
│       ├── plan.md              # Technical implementation (HOW)
│       ├── tasks.md             # Actionable task breakdown
│       ├── data-model.md        # Data models
│       ├── quickstart.md        # Quick start guide
│       ├── research.md          # Research findings
│       └── contracts/
│           ├── api-spec.json
│           └── signalr-spec.md
└── templates/
    ├── spec-template.md
    ├── plan-template.md
    └── tasks-template.md
```

**Key Characteristics**:
- Features numbered: `001-photo-albums`, `002-user-auth`
- Three core documents per feature: `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`
- Constitution stored in `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
- Templates for consistency

#### 2. Seven-Step Workflow

**spec-kit has a linear, sequential workflow:**

| Step | Command | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| 1 | `/speckit.constitution` | Establish project principles |
| 2 | `/speckit.specify` | Create functional specifications |
| 3 | `/speckit.clarify` | Structured requirement refinement |
| 4 | `/speckit.plan` | Generate technical plan |
| 5 | Validate Plan | Manual review step |
| 6 | `/speckit.tasks` | Generate task breakdown |
| 7 | `/speckit.implement` | Execute implementation |

**Optional Commands:**
- `/speckit.analyze` - Cross-artifact consistency validation
- `/speckit.checklist` - Custom quality validation

#### 3. CLI Installation & Commands

**Installation:**
```bash
# Persistent installation
uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git

# One-time usage
uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init <PROJECT_NAME>
```

**CLI Commands:**
```bash
# Initialize project
specify init <PROJECT_NAME> [options]

# Check prerequisites
specify check

# Options for init:
--ai [claude|gemini|copilot|cursor-agent|windsurf|...]  # Specify AI
--script [sh|ps]                                         # Shell variant
--here / --force                                         # Initialize in current dir
--no-git                                                 # Skip Git init
--ignore-agent-tools                                     # Skip agent detection
--debug                                                  # Troubleshooting
```

#### 4. Supported AI Agents

spec-kit supports **14+ AI coding agents** (agent-agnostic):
- Claude Code ✅
- GitHub Copilot ✅
- Gemini CLI ✅
- Cursor ✅
- Windsurf ✅
- Qwen Code ✅
- opencode ✅
- Roo Code ✅
- Codex CLI ✅
- Kilo Code ✅
- Auggie CLI ✅
- CodeBuddy CLI ✅
- Amp ✅
- Amazon Q Developer CLI ⚠️ (limited support)

**Key Point**: spec-kit is **agent-agnostic** - works with ANY AI agent supporting slash commands.

#### 5. Constitutional Governance

**spec-kit's `/speckit.constitution` command creates governing principles:**

**Constitution document** (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`):
- Code quality standards
- Testing requirements
- UX consistency guidelines
- Performance requirements
- Security standards
- Accessibility guidelines

**How it works:**
1. User runs `/speckit.constitution`
2. AI prompts for project principles
3. Creates `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
4. All subsequent commands reference this constitution
5. Ensures consistent decision-making throughout development

**Example constitution:**
```markdown
# Project Constitution

## Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint configuration enforced
- 80%+ test coverage required

## Testing Standards
- TDD approach for all features
- E2E tests for critical paths
- Unit tests for pure functions

## UX Consistency
- Material Design guidelines
- Responsive design mandatory
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
```

#### 6. Task Breakdown Intelligence

**spec-kit's `/speckit.tasks` command generates advanced task breakdowns:**

**Features:**
- ✅ Hierarchically organized by user story
- ✅ Dependency management (tasks marked with prerequisites)
- ✅ Parallel execution markers (`[P]` for parallelizable tasks)
- ✅ File path references (which files to modify)
- ✅ TDD structure (write tests before implementation)
- ✅ Ordered execution sequence

**Example tasks.md:**
```markdown
# Tasks: User Authentication

## User Story 1: User Login

### Tests (TDD)
- [ ] [P] Write unit tests for login validation (auth.test.ts)
- [ ] [P] Write E2E tests for login flow (login.spec.ts)

### Implementation
- [ ] Create login API endpoint (src/api/auth.ts) [depends: tests]
- [ ] Implement JWT token generation (src/auth/jwt.ts) [depends: tests]
- [ ] Create login UI component (src/components/Login.tsx)

### Integration
- [ ] Connect login UI to API (src/pages/LoginPage.tsx) [depends: implementation]
- [ ] Add error handling and validation
```

**Dependency tracking:** Tasks explicitly state dependencies (e.g., `[depends: tests]`)

#### 7. Three Development Phases

spec-kit supports **three development approaches:**

**1. 0-to-1 Development (Greenfield)**
- Build applications from scratch
- Complete spec → plan → tasks → implement workflow
- Technology-agnostic (choose any stack)

**2. Creative Exploration**
- Parallel implementations with diverse tech stacks
- Rapid prototyping
- Compare multiple approaches before committing

**3. Iterative Enhancement (Brownfield)**
- Legacy modernization
- Incremental improvements
- Add specs to existing codebases

#### 8. Multi-Step Refinement Process

**spec-kit emphasizes clarity before implementation:**

**Workflow:**
1. **Constitution** → Establish principles
2. **Specify** → Define requirements
3. **Clarify** → Structured questioning (critical step!)
4. **Plan** → Technical strategy
5. **Validate** → Manual review (avoid over-engineering)
6. **Tasks** → Granular breakdown
7. **Implement** → Execution

**Clarify step** (`/speckit.clarify`):
- Structured, sequential questioning
- Surfaces underspecified areas
- Records answers in Clarifications section
- Prevents ambiguity downstream

**Example clarifications:**
```markdown
## Clarifications

**Q1**: Should password reset be via email or SMS?
**A1**: Email only for MVP, SMS in future phase

**Q2**: What's the minimum password complexity?
**A2**: 8 characters, 1 uppercase, 1 number, 1 special char

**Q3**: Session timeout duration?
**A3**: 30 minutes of inactivity
```

### spec-kit Strengths (Known Features)

1. ✅ **Agent-Agnostic** - Works with 14+ AI coding agents (not locked to Claude)
2. ✅ **Constitutional Governance** - Project principles guide all decisions
3. ✅ **Clarification Workflow** - Structured questioning prevents ambiguity
4. ✅ **Task Breakdown Intelligence** - Dependency-aware, parallel markers, TDD structure

2. ❌ **No Auto-Role Routing** - User must manually invoke commands in sequence
3. ❌ **No Brownfield Analyzer** - No automated analysis of existing codebases
4. ❌ **No Agent System** - Only slash commands (no separate agent personalities)
5. ❌ **No E2E Testing Enforcement** - TDD suggested but not mandatory
6. ❌ **No Hooks System** - No automation for doc updates, validations
7. ❌ **No Skills System** - No extensible skill framework
8. ❌ **Linear Only** - Must follow 7-step sequence (less flexible)
9. ❌ **No Incremental Docs** - Requires upfront specification (no gradual approach)
10. ❌ **No Multi-Agent Orchestration** - Single conversation context

## Gap Analysis Workflow (Dynamic)

When you request gap analysis, I will:

### Step 1: Analyze Current SpecWeave State

**I will read and analyze:**
```bash
# Project structure
- CLAUDE.md (complete guide)
- .specweave/increments/ (implemented features)
- src/skills/ (available skills)
- src/agents/ (available agents)
- specifications/ (spec organization)
- .specweave/docs/ (documentation structure)
- .claude/hooks/ (automation hooks)

# Features and capabilities
- What features exist in .specweave/increments/
- What skills exist in src/skills/
- What agents exist in src/agents/
- What's documented in .specweave/docs/
- What's planned in roadmap
- What hooks are configured
```

### Step 2: Compare to spec-kit (Static Knowledge)

**I will compare:**
- **Workflow**: Continuous/flexible (SpecWeave) vs Linear/sequential (spec-kit)
- **Role system**: Skills + Agents (SpecWeave) vs Slash commands only (spec-kit)
- **Context management**: Manifests (SpecWeave) vs Load all (spec-kit)
- **Documentation**: Incremental + upfront (SpecWeave) vs Upfront only (spec-kit)
- **Brownfield support**: Analyzer + regression (SpecWeave) vs Manual (spec-kit)
- **Agent support**: Claude-focused (SpecWeave) vs 14+ agents (spec-kit)
- **Testing**: Mandatory E2E (SpecWeave) vs TDD suggested (spec-kit)
- **Automation**: Hooks system (SpecWeave) vs Scripts (spec-kit)
- **Constitution**: Built-in CLAUDE.md (SpecWeave) vs /speckit.constitution (spec-kit)
- **Task breakdown**: Context-aware (SpecWeave) vs Dependency-aware (spec-kit)

### Step 3: Generate Gap Analysis Report

**Report includes:**

**A. What spec-kit Has That SpecWeave Lacks**
- Features present in spec-kit
- Not implemented in SpecWeave
- Priority assessment (critical, nice-to-have)
- Implementation difficulty

**B. What SpecWeave Has That spec-kit Lacks**
- Features present in SpecWeave
- Not in spec-kit
- Unique benefits
- Why it matters

**C. Different Approaches (Not Gaps)**
- Features both have, implemented differently
- Trade-offs
- Use case suitability

**D. Recommendations**
- Which framework for which use case
- Hybrid approaches
- Adoption strategy

### Step 4: Answer Your Specific Question

Based on analysis, provide:
- Direct answer to your question
- Supporting evidence from both frameworks
- Concrete examples
- Actionable recommendations

## Example Interactions

### Example 1: General Gap Analysis

**User**: "Compare SpecWeave to spec-kit - what are the gaps?"

**I will**:
1. Read current SpecWeave state:
   ```bash
   - Check .specweave/increments/ for implemented capabilities
   - Read src/skills/ for available skills
   - Read src/agents/ for available agents
   - Review CLAUDE.md for documented features
   - Settings auto-detected for configuration
   - Analyze .claude/hooks/ for automation
   ```

2. Compare to spec-kit knowledge:
   - Constitutional governance (spec-kit has `/speckit.constitution`)
   - Agent-agnostic support (spec-kit has 14+ agents)
   - Task breakdown (spec-kit has dependency tracking)
   - Clarification workflow (spec-kit has `/speckit.clarify`)
   - Linear workflow (spec-kit has strict 7-step process)
   - Template system (spec-kit has standardized templates)

3. Generate report:
   ```markdown
   # Gap Analysis: spec-kit vs SpecWeave

   ## Analysis Date: [current date]
   ## SpecWeave Version: [from config or git]
   ## spec-kit Version: Latest (GitHub: github/spec-kit)

   ### Gaps: spec-kit Features Missing in SpecWeave

   [... continue ...]

   ### Different Approaches (Not Gaps)

   1. **Workflow Philosophy**
      - spec-kit: Linear 7-step process (structured, sequential)
      - SpecWeave: Continuous, flexible workflow (adapt to project needs)
      - Trade-off: spec-kit = predictable, SpecWeave = adaptable
      - Use case: spec-kit for teams needing strict process, SpecWeave for dynamic teams

   2. **Constitution vs CLAUDE.md**
      - spec-kit: `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (project-specific principles)
      - SpecWeave: `CLAUDE.md` (comprehensive development guide + principles)
      - Trade-off: spec-kit = minimal principles, SpecWeave = complete guide
      - Use case: spec-kit for simple projects, SpecWeave for complex systems

   3. **Directory Structure**
      - spec-kit: `.specify/` (specs/, memory/, scripts/, templates/)
      - SpecWeave: `.specweave/` (increments/, docs/, cache/, tests/)
      - Trade-off: spec-kit = flat, SpecWeave = hierarchical
      - Use case: Both work, naming preference

   ### Recommendations

   **Use spec-kit if:**
   - You want agent-agnostic framework (Copilot, Cursor, Gemini, etc.)
   - You prefer strict linear workflow (7 steps, no deviation)
   - You need simple projects with small specs (<50 pages)
   - You want GitHub-official backing (42.1K+ stars)
   - You prioritize simplicity over flexibility

   **Use SpecWeave if:**
   - You want enterprise-scale features (context manifests, 500+ page specs)
   - You need brownfield support (legacy codebases)
   - You prioritize mandatory E2E testing (production confidence)
   - You want skills/agents extensibility (custom capabilities)
   - You need automation (hooks for doc updates, validations)
   - You prefer flexible workflow (incremental OR comprehensive docs)
   - You want multi-agent orchestration (PM, Architect, DevOps, etc.)

   **Hybrid approach:**
   - Use spec-kit's `/speckit.clarify` mindset for SpecWeave specs (implement as skill)
   - Use spec-kit's task dependency tracking in SpecWeave `tasks.md`
   - Use SpecWeave's context manifests for large spec-kit projects (if possible)
   - Use spec-kit's constitutional governance + SpecWeave's CLAUDE.md (complementary)
   ```

### Example 2: Specific Feature Question

**User**: "How does spec-kit handle task breakdown?"

**I will**:
1. Explain spec-kit task breakdown (static knowledge)
2. Show `/speckit.tasks` command and examples
3. Compare to SpecWeave approach (read increment-planner skill if exists)
4. Highlight differences

**Response**:
```markdown
# spec-kit Task Breakdown Workflow

## spec-kit Approach

spec-kit's `/speckit.tasks` command generates intelligent task breakdowns:

**Features:**
- ✅ Hierarchically organized by user story
- ✅ Dependency management (`[depends: tests]`)
- ✅ Parallel execution markers (`[P]` for parallelizable tasks)
- ✅ File path references (which files to modify)
- ✅ TDD structure (write tests before implementation)
- ✅ Ordered execution sequence

**Example tasks.md:**
```markdown
# Tasks: User Authentication

## User Story 1: User Login

### Tests (TDD)
- [ ] [P] Write unit tests for login validation (auth.test.ts)
- [ ] [P] Write E2E tests for login flow (login.spec.ts)

### Implementation
- [ ] Create login API endpoint (src/api/auth.ts) [depends: tests]
- [ ] Implement JWT token generation (src/auth/jwt.ts) [depends: tests]
- [ ] Create login UI component (src/components/Login.tsx)

### Integration
- [ ] Connect login UI to API (src/pages/LoginPage.tsx) [depends: implementation]
- [ ] Add error handling and validation

## User Story 2: User Logout

[... continue ...]
```

**Key Characteristics:**
1. **Dependency tracking**: Explicit `[depends: ...]` notation
2. **Parallel markers**: `[P]` indicates tasks can run in parallel
3. **File paths**: Every task includes exact file path
4. **TDD first**: Tests written before implementation
5. **Grouped by user story**: Clear organization

## SpecWeave Approach (Current State)

[Read and analyze src/skills/increment-planner/ and increments/*/tasks.md]

- **increment-planner skill**: Creates tasks.md in `.specweave/increments/`
- **Structure**: Similar hierarchical organization
- **Missing**: Explicit dependency notation (`[depends: ...]`)
- **Missing**: Parallel markers (`[P]`)
- **Strength**: Context manifests (knows what specs to load)
- **Strength**: Integrated with skills/agents (auto-routing)

**Example SpecWeave tasks.md:**
```markdown
# Tasks: User Authentication

## Specification Phase
- [ ] Create specification in specifications/modules/auth/
- [ ] Define acceptance criteria (TC-0001 format)
- [ ] Create context manifest

## Planning Phase
- [ ] Design architecture (.specweave/docs/architecture/)
- [ ] Create ADRs for tech stack decisions
- [ ] Define data models

## Implementation Phase
- [ ] Write E2E tests (tests/e2e/login.spec.ts) - MANDATORY
- [ ] Implement login API endpoint
- [ ] Implement JWT authentication
- [ ] Create login UI component

## Validation Phase
- [ ] Run E2E tests (must pass)
- [ ] Update documentation (auto via hooks)
- [ ] Create completion report
```

**Key Characteristics:**
1. **Phase-based**: Spec → Plan → Implement → Validate
2. **Context-aware**: Loads only relevant specs
3. **E2E mandatory**: Tests required when UI exists
4. **Auto-documentation**: Hooks update docs automatically
5. **Less granular**: No explicit dependencies or parallel markers

## Comparison

| Aspect | spec-kit | SpecWeave |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Dependency tracking | ✅ Explicit `[depends: ...]` | ❌ Not explicit |
| Parallel markers | ✅ `[P]` notation | ❌ Not explicit |
| File paths | ✅ In every task | ⚠️ Sometimes included |
| TDD structure | ✅ Tests first | ✅ E2E mandatory (when UI) |
| Granularity | ✅ Very granular | ⚠️ Medium granularity |
| Context awareness | ❌ Not context-aware | ✅ Context manifests |
| Auto-routing | ❌ Manual commands | ✅ Skills auto-activate |
| Organization | By user story | By phase (spec/plan/implement) |

## Recommendation

**Enhance SpecWeave with spec-kit task features:**
1. ✅ Add explicit dependency notation (`[depends: ...]`) to tasks.md
2. ✅ Add parallel markers (`[P]`) for concurrent tasks
3. ✅ Ensure file paths in every task
4. ✅ Maintain E2E mandatory requirement (SpecWeave strength)
5. ✅ Keep context awareness (SpecWeave strength)

**Implementation:**
- Update `increment-planner` skill to generate spec-kit-style dependencies
- Add parallel detection logic (identify independent tasks)
- Keep phase-based structure (SpecWeave's strength)

# Framework Recommendation: Greenfield SaaS Application

## Use Case Analysis

**Project Characteristics:**
- ✅ Greenfield (starting from scratch)
- ✅ SaaS application (likely complex, multi-tenant)
- ✅ Scalability requirements (enterprise potential)
- ✅ Likely large specifications (50-200+ pages)
- ✅ Need for structured development process
- ⚠️ May need multi-agent collaboration (frontend, backend, DevOps)

## spec-kit Approach

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Clear 7-step workflow (constitution → spec → clarify → plan → tasks → implement)
- ✅ Agent-agnostic (use any AI: Claude, Copilot, Cursor, etc.)
- ✅ Clarification workflow prevents ambiguity
- ✅ GitHub-official (42.1K+ stars, trusted)
- ✅ Template system (consistent specs)
- ✅ Simple setup (`specify init my-saas`)

**Challenges:**
- ❌ No context manifests (loads all specs = high token usage for large SaaS)
- ❌ No brownfield support (if you need to integrate legacy systems later)
- ❌ No mandatory E2E testing (TDD suggested only)
- ❌ Linear workflow (must follow 7 steps strictly)
- ❌ No multi-agent orchestration (single conversation)
- ❌ No automation hooks (manual doc updates)

## SpecWeave Approach (Current State)

[Read and analyze SpecWeave features for greenfield]

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Context manifests (70%+ token reduction = cost savings for large SaaS)
- ✅ Multi-agent system (PM, Architect, Frontend, Backend, DevOps, QA)
- ✅ Mandatory E2E testing (production confidence)
- ✅ Flexible workflow (incremental OR comprehensive docs)
- ✅ Hooks system (auto-update docs, zero overhead)
- ✅ Skills extensibility (custom SaaS-specific skills)
- ✅ Incremental docs (start small, grow to 500+ pages)

**Challenges:**
- ⚠️ Claude-focused (not agent-agnostic like spec-kit)
- ⚠️ More complex initial setup (more features = steeper learning curve)
- ⚠️ Less GitHub popularity (new framework vs spec-kit's 42.1K stars)
- ❌ No structured clarification workflow (spec-kit has this)

## Recommendation

**🎯 Use SpecWeave for this use case**

**Reasons:**
1. **Scale**: SaaS apps grow large (100-500+ pages of specs) → context manifests critical
2. **Multi-agent**: SaaS needs PM, Architect, Frontend, Backend, DevOps collaboration
3. **E2E testing**: SaaS in production requires truth-telling tests (mandatory)
4. **Flexibility**: Start with 20-page spec (MVP), grow to 200+ pages (enterprise)
5. **Automation**: Hooks keep docs updated as SaaS evolves

**Augment with spec-kit concepts:**
- ✅ Use spec-kit's `/speckit.clarify` mindset (implement as SpecWeave skill)
- ✅ Adopt spec-kit's dependency notation in tasks.md
- ✅ Reference spec-kit's constitutional governance approach

**Implementation Path:**
1. `specweave init --greenfield` (or equivalent)
2. Create initial spec (20-30 pages for MVP)
3. Use PM agent for product requirements
4. Use Architect agent for system design
5. Create increments with context manifests
6. Implement with mandatory E2E tests
7. Scale to 200+ pages as SaaS grows

**Alternative: Use spec-kit if:**
- You want agent flexibility (switch between Claude, Copilot, Cursor)
- You prefer strict linear workflow (less flexibility = less decisions)
- Your SaaS specs stay small (<50 pages)
- You don't need multi-agent orchestration
```
