**As a** [user type]
**I want** [goal/desire]
**So that** [benefit/value]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] [Specific, testable criterion]
- [ ] [Another criterion]

**Story Points**: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13] (Fibonacci scale)

**Dependencies**: [Other user stories or systems]

**Notes**: [Additional context, edge cases]
```

**Example**:
```markdown
### US-001: User Registration (Priority: P1)

**As a** new user
**I want** to create an account with my email
**So that** I can access the task management system

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] User can enter email, password, and name
- [ ] Email must be unique (show error if exists)
- [ ] Password validation: 8+ chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number
- [ ] Confirmation email sent within 30 seconds
- [ ] User redirected to onboarding after registration
- [ ] Account not active until email confirmed

**Story Points**: 5

**Dependencies**:

- Database schema for users table

**Notes**:
- Consider social login (US-002) as alternative
- GDPR compliance: User can delete account
```

### 4. Feature Prioritization

**Frameworks Supported**:

#### RICE Score
```
RICE = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Example:
Feature: Real-time Collaboration
- Reach: 8000 users/quarter (80% of user base)
- Impact: 3 (Massive impact on user satisfaction)
- Confidence: 70% (some unknowns in WebSocket scalability)
- Effort: 8 person-weeks

RICE = (8000 × 3 × 0.7) / 8 = 2100

Higher RICE = Higher Priority
```

#### MoSCoW
- **Must Have**: Critical for MVP, without these product fails
- **Should Have**: Important but not critical, workarounds exist
- **Could Have**: Nice-to-have, adds value but not essential
- **Won't Have**: Out of scope for this release

#### Kano Model
- **Basic Needs**: Users expect these (authentication, data persistence)
- **Performance Needs**: More is better (speed, reliability)
- **Excitement Needs**: Unexpected delights (AI suggestions, beautiful UI)

**Output Example**:
```markdown

## Stakeholder Update: Microservices Architecture

### Business Impact Summary
We're proposing a shift from monolithic to microservices architecture. Here's what this means for the business:

**Benefits**:
1. **Faster Feature Delivery** (30% improvement)
   - Teams can work independently without blocking each other
   - Deploy updates without full system downtime
   - Estimated time-to-market: 3 weeks → 2 weeks per feature

2. **Better Scalability** (2x cost efficiency)
   - Scale only the parts that need it (save $50K/year in infrastructure)
   - Handle Black Friday traffic spikes without over-provisioning

3. **Reduced Risk** (99.9% → 99.99% uptime)
   - If one service fails, others keep running
   - Estimated downtime reduction: 8 hours/year → 1 hour/year
   - Revenue protected: ~$200K/year

**Costs**:
- Initial migration: 8 weeks of engineering time
- New monitoring tools: +$5K/year
- Short-term productivity dip during migration

**ROI**: Break-even in 6 months, $100K+ net benefit in Year 1

**Recommendation**: Approve for Q3 implementation
```

## Testing

### Test Cases

**TC-001: Product Vision Creation**
- Given: User wants to build "Task Management SaaS"
- When: PM Agent activates
- Then: Creates product vision document with problem, users, value prop, goals

**TC-002: User Story Generation**
- Given: Feature requirement "User Authentication"
- When: PM Agent generates user stories
- Then: Creates 5+ user stories with acceptance criteria, priorities, story points

**TC-003: Feature Prioritization**
- Given: 10 feature ideas
- When: PM Agent applies RICE scoring
- Then: Ranks features by RICE score, categorizes as P1/P2/P3

**TC-004: Roadmap Creation**
- Given: Product vision and prioritized features
- When: PM Agent creates roadmap
- Then: Generates quarterly roadmap with themes, features, timelines, metrics

**TC-005: Stakeholder Translation**
- Given: Technical proposal "Move to microservices"
- When: PM Agent translates for stakeholders
- Then: Creates business impact summary with ROI, benefits, costs, recommendation

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Start with "Why"

Before defining features, understand:
- What problem are we solving?
- Who has this problem?
- Why is this valuable to users/business?

### 2. Write Specific Acceptance Criteria

Bad:
- "Login should work"

Good:
- "User can log in with email and password"
- "Invalid credentials show error message 'Invalid email or password'"
- "After 5 failed attempts, account locked for 15 minutes"

### 3. Prioritize Ruthlessly

Not everything can be P1. Use frameworks (RICE, MoSCoW) to make data-driven decisions.

### 4. Measure Everything

Define KPIs upfront. If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.

### 5. Communicate in Business Language

Avoid technical jargon with stakeholders. Focus on:
- Revenue impact
- Time savings
- Risk reduction
- Customer satisfaction
