# SpecWeave Detector & Entry Point

This skill is the **automatic entry point** for all SpecWeave operations. When Claude Code detects a `.specweave/config.yaml` file, this skill activates and orchestrates the SpecWeave framework.

## Purpose

Act as the "factory of agents" that:
1. Detects SpecWeave projects automatically
2. Parses user requests
3. Routes to appropriate skills
4. Orchestrates nested skill calls
5. Manages context loading

## Detection Logic

```javascript
// Pseudo-code for detection
if (fileExists('.specweave/config.yaml')) {
  activateSpecWeaveMode();
  loadConfiguration();
  parseUserIntent();
  routeToSkills();
}
```

## Auto-Activation

**Key Feature**: This skill uses Claude Code's `proactive: true` feature to load automatically.

When a user opens a project with `.specweave/` directory:
1. Claude Code detects the directory
2. This skill loads proactively (no user action needed)
3. SpecWeave mode activates silently
4. User requests are automatically routed to appropriate skills

**User Experience**:
```
# User doesn't know SpecWeave is active
User: "I want to add payment processing"

# Behind the scenes:
# 1. specweave-detector intercepts request
# 2. Parses request: "add feature" + "payment processing"
# 3. Routes to: feature-planner skill
# 4. feature-planner creates Feature 002
# 5. Returns result to user

# User sees:
âœ… Feature created: 002-payment-processing
```

## Request Parsing & Routing

### Simple Request (Single Skill)

| User Says | Request Type | Route To |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| "Plan a feature for..." | feature_planning | `feature-planner` |
| "Load context for..." | context_loading | `context-loader` |
| "Document this code..." | documentation | `docs-updater` |
| "Create a spec for..." | specification | `spec-author` |
| "Design architecture for..." | architecture | `architect` |
| "Implement feature 001" | development | `developer` |
| "Test this feature" | testing | `qa-engineer` |

### Complex Request (Multiple Skills)

**Example**: "Create and implement a new payment feature"

**Request Breakdown**:
1. Create feature â†’ `feature-planner`
2. Implement code â†’ Load context via `context-loader`
3. Implement code â†’ `developer`
4. Generate tests â†’ `qa-engineer`
5. Update docs â†’ `docs-updater`

**Execution Flow**:
```
User: "Create and implement a new payment feature"
    â†“
specweave-detector parses: CREATE + IMPLEMENT + FEATURE + PAYMENT
    â†“
Orchestrate nested skills:
    â†“
feature-planner: Create 003-payment-processing/
    â†“
context-loader: Load specs/modules/payments/**
    â†“
developer: Implement based on tasks.md
    â†“
qa-engineer: Generate test cases
    â†“
docs-updater: Update README, docs/
    â†“
Result: "âœ… Feature 003 implemented and documented"
```

### Ambiguous Request

When request is unclear:
```
User: "Help me with the authentication"
    â†“
specweave-detector: Ambiguous (help = ?)
    â†“
Route to skill-router for clarification
    â†“
skill-router asks:
"What would you like to do with authentication?
1. Create a specification
2. Plan implementation
3. Implement code
4. Document existing code"
```

## Context Management

### Automatic Context Loading

When a user is working on a feature:

```javascript
// Detect active work
const activeIssue = detectActiveIssue(); // work/issues/###-xxx/

if (activeIssue) {
  const manifest = loadManifest(`${activeIssue}/context-manifest.yaml`);
  const context = await contextLoader.load(manifest);
  // Context now available for all skills
}
```

### Context Prioritization

When multiple contexts are relevant:

1. **Active work item** (in `work/issues/`)
2. **Current feature** (referenced in git branch)
3. **User-specified** context
4. **Global** context (specs/overview.md, principles.md)

## Skill Orchestration

### Parallel Execution

Some skills can run in parallel:

```
User: "Create tests and update documentation"
    â†“
Parallel execution:
â”œâ”€ qa-engineer: Generate tests
â””â”€ docs-updater: Update docs

Wait for both to complete
    â†“
Result: "âœ… Tests generated (15 test cases) and docs updated"
```

### Sequential Execution

Some skills must run sequentially:

```
User: "Plan and implement feature 001"
    â†“
Sequential execution:
1. feature-planner: Create plan (MUST complete first)
2. context-loader: Load relevant specs (uses plan output)
3. developer: Implement (uses loaded context)

Each step waits for previous to complete
```

### Error Handling

If a skill fails:

```
User: "Implement feature 005"
    â†“
specweave-detector: Route to developer
    â†“
developer: ERROR - Feature 005 not found
    â†“
specweave-detector: Catch error, suggest:
"Feature 005 doesn't exist. Would you like to:
1. Create it first (feature-planner)
2. List existing features
3. Implement a different feature"
```

## Configuration Awareness

Load and respect `.specweave/config.yaml`:

```yaml
# .specweave/config.yaml
principles:
  auto_role_routing: true        # Enable auto-routing
  context_precision: true         # Use context manifests
  routing_accuracy_target: 0.90   # Accuracy threshold

skills:
  install_location: "local"       # Where skills are installed
  auto_install: true              # Auto-install missing skills

integrations:
  github:
    enabled: true
    sync_issues: true             # Sync features â†” GitHub issues
```

When `auto_role_routing: false`, this skill still activates but prompts user for explicit skill selection.

## SpecWeave Mode Indicator

When SpecWeave is active, include a subtle indicator in responses:

```
ðŸ”· SpecWeave Active

[Normal response here]
```

This helps users know SpecWeave framework is orchestrating their request.

## Skill Discovery

List available skills:

```bash
User: "What can SpecWeave do?"
    â†“
specweave-detector: List installed skills

SpecWeave Skills:
âœ… feature-planner - Plan implementation features
âœ… context-loader - Selective specification loading
âœ… skill-router - Route ambiguous intents
ðŸ“¦ spec-author - Create specifications (install with: npx specweave install spec-author)
ðŸ“¦ architect - System design (install with: npx specweave install architect)

Custom Skills:
âœ… newrelic-monitor - New Relic integration
âœ… cqrs-implementer - CQRS pattern implementation
```

## Nested Skill Example

**User Request**: "I want to build a real-time chat feature"

**SpecWeave Detector Processing**:

```
1. Parse Request: BUILD + FEATURE + REAL_TIME_CHAT
   Request: feature_creation + complex_feature

2. Route to feature-planner:
   Input: "Real-time chat feature"
   Output: features/004-realtime-chat/
           - spec.md (5 user stories)
           - plan.md (WebSocket architecture)
           - tasks.md (78 tasks)
           - tests.md (20 test cases)

3. Detect next request: User likely wants to implement
   Prompt: "Feature 004 created. Would you like to:
           1. Review the plan
           2. Start implementation
           3. Load context for this feature"

4. User chooses 2 (Start implementation)

5. Route to context-loader:
   Load: features/004-realtime-chat/context-manifest.yaml
   Output: Loaded specs/modules/realtime/**, architecture/websockets.md

6. Route to developer:
   Input: features/004-realtime-chat/tasks.md
   Context: Loaded specs
   Output: Implement Phase 1 (Setup WebSocket server)

7. After implementation, route to qa-engineer:
   Input: features/004-realtime-chat/tests.md
   Output: Generate test suite

8. Finally, route to docs-updater:
   Update: docs/reference/api.md (add WebSocket endpoints)

9. Return to user:
   âœ… Feature 004 implemented, tested, and documented
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Transparent Routing

Always inform user which skill is being activated:

```
ðŸ”· SpecWeave Active

Routing to feature-planner skill to create your payment feature...

[feature-planner output]
```

### 2. Confirm Complex Operations

For multi-step operations, confirm before proceeding:

```
You want to "create and implement a payment feature".

This will:
1. Create Feature 003 (feature-planner)
2. Load relevant specs (context-loader)
3. Implement code (developer)
4. Generate tests (qa-engineer)
5. Update documentation (docs-updater)

Estimated time: 15-30 minutes

Proceed? (yes/no)
```

### 3. Fail Gracefully

If SpecWeave can't handle a request:

```
I detected this is a SpecWeave project, but I'm not sure how to handle:
"What's the weather like?"

This seems outside SpecWeave's domain (software development).
Would you like me to answer as regular Claude instead?
```

### 4. Learn from Usage

Track routing decisions to improve accuracy:

```javascript
// Log for analysis
logRoutingDecision({
  userInput: "Add Stripe payments",
  parsedRequest: "feature_creation + payments",
  routedTo: "feature-planner",
  wasCorrect: true, // User feedback
  timestamp: Date.now()
});
```

## Integration with Other Skills

All SpecWeave skills should check if `specweave-detector` is active:

```javascript
// In any skill
if (specweaveDetectorActive()) {
  // Access loaded context
  const context = getSpecWeaveContext();
  // Use centralized routing
  routeToSkill('context-loader', params);
}
```

## Testing

### TC-001: Detect SpecWeave Project
- Given: Directory with `.specweave/config.yaml`
- When: Claude Code opens directory
- Then: specweave-detector activates automatically

### TC-002: Route Simple Request
- Given: User says "Plan a feature for authentication"
- When: specweave-detector parses request
- Then: Routes to feature-planner
- And: feature-planner creates Feature 00X

### TC-003: Route Complex Request
- Given: User says "Create and implement payment feature"
- When: specweave-detector parses request
- Then: Orchestrates: feature-planner â†’ context-loader â†’ developer â†’ qa-engineer â†’ docs-updater
- And: All steps complete successfully

### TC-004: Handle Ambiguous Request
- Given: User says "Help with auth"
- When: specweave-detector cannot determine clear request
- Then: Routes to skill-router for clarification
- And: Presents options to user

### TC-005: Graceful Degradation
- Given: SpecWeave project
- When: User asks non-development question ("What's for lunch?")
- Then: specweave-detector recognizes out-of-domain
- And: Falls back to regular Claude
