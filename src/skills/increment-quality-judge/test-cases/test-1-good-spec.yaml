    # Authentication Feature

    ## Overview
    Implement JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens for secure user access.

    ## Acceptance Criteria
    - AC-001: User can log in with email/password, receiving JWT token within 2 seconds
    - AC-002: JWT token expires after 1 hour, requires refresh
    - AC-003: Failed login attempts (>5) lock account for 15 minutes
    - AC-004: Password must be 8+ characters with uppercase, lowercase, number, special char

    ## Security
    - Passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost factor: 12)
    - JWTs signed with RS256 (private key rotation every 90 days)
    - Rate limiting: 5 login attempts per 15 minutes per IP

    ## Performance
    - Login latency: p95 < 500ms, p99 < 1000ms
    - Concurrent logins: Support 100 logins/second

    ## Error Handling
    - Invalid credentials: Return 401 with error code AUTH_001
    - Account locked: Return 403 with error code AUTH_002
    - Rate limit exceeded: Return 429 with retry-after header
