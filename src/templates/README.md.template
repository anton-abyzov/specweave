# {{PROJECT_NAME}}

**A SpecWeave project** - where specifications drive development.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Your project is initialized! Now describe what you want to build.

### Next Steps

1. **Open Claude Code** (the AI assistant you're using)

2. **Describe your project** in natural language:

```
"Build a real estate listing platform with search, images, and admin dashboard"
"Create a task management API with authentication"
"Build an e-commerce platform with Stripe payments"
```

3. **SpecWeave will automatically**:
   - Detect your tech stack (or ask you to choose)
   - Install needed agents & skills on-demand
   - Create strategic documentation
   - Generate specifications
   - Build the implementation
   - Write tests

That's it! No manual configuration needed.

## 🎯 What is SpecWeave?

SpecWeave is a spec-driven development framework where:
- **Specifications are the source of truth** (code follows specs)
- **AI agents work autonomously** (PM, Architect, Security, QA, DevOps)
- **Components auto-install on-demand** (no manual setup)
- **Works with ANY tech stack** (TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, etc.)
