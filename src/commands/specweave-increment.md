# Plan Product Increment

**PM-Led Workflow**: From market research to ready-to-build increment.

You are helping the user create a new SpecWeave increment with automatic closure of previous increment if ready.

## Steps:

### Step 0: Smart Check Previous Increment (if applicable)

**üéØ CRITICAL: Suggest, don't force** - help user make informed decision!

1. **Check for in-progress increments**:
   ```bash
   # Find increments with status: in-progress
   grep -r "status: in-progress" .specweave/increments/*/spec.md
   ```

2. **If previous increment found, validate PM gates**:
   - **Gate 1**: All P1 tasks completed?
   - **Gate 2**: Tests passing (>80% coverage)?
   - **Gate 3**: Documentation updated (CLAUDE.md, README.md)?

3. **Decision matrix** (NEVER force, ALWAYS suggest):
   ```
   All gates ‚úÖ ‚Üí Auto-close previous, create new (seamless)

   Any gate ‚ùå ‚Üí STOP and present options (user decides):
      Option A: Complete 0001 first (recommended)
         ‚Üí Finish remaining work before starting new

      Option B: Move incomplete tasks to 0002
         ‚Üí Transfer T006, T007 to new increment
         ‚Üí Close 0001 as "completed with deferrals"

      Option C: Cancel new increment
         ‚Üí Stay on 0001, continue working
         ‚Üí User will retry /inc when ready
   ```

**CRITICAL**: NEVER auto-close with incomplete work! Always give user control.

4. **Auto-close output** (if gates pass):
   ```
   üìä Previous Increment Check

   Found: 0001-user-authentication (in-progress)

   PM Gate Validation:
   ‚îú‚îÄ Gate 1 (Tasks): 8/8 P1 completed ‚úÖ
   ‚îú‚îÄ Gate 2 (Tests): 5/5 passing (85% coverage) ‚úÖ
   ‚îî‚îÄ Gate 3 (Docs): CLAUDE.md ‚úÖ, README.md ‚úÖ

   ‚úÖ Auto-closing increment 0001...

   Proceeding with new increment 0002...
   ```

5. **Prompt output** (if gates fail):
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Previous Increment Incomplete

   Found: 0001-user-authentication (in-progress)

   PM Gate Validation:
   ‚îú‚îÄ Gate 1 (Tasks): 6/8 P1 completed ‚ùå (2 P1 tasks remaining)
   ‚îú‚îÄ Gate 2 (Tests): 3/5 passing (60% coverage) ‚ùå
   ‚îî‚îÄ Gate 3 (Docs): CLAUDE.md ‚úÖ, README.md ‚è≥

   Options:
   A. Complete 0001 first (recommended)
      ‚Üí Run `/do 0001` to finish remaining tasks

   B. Force close 0001 and defer tasks to 0002
      ‚Üí Transfer T006, T007 to new increment

   C. Cancel and stay on 0001
      ‚Üí Continue working on authentication

   What would you like to do? (A/B/C)
   ```

**Why suggest, not force?**
- ‚úÖ User stays in control (no surprises)
- ‚úÖ Natural flow in happy path (auto-close if ready)
- ‚úÖ Clear options when incomplete (complete, defer, or cancel)
- ‚úÖ Enforces quality awareness (can't ignore incomplete work)
- ‚úÖ No manual `/done` needed when gates pass

### Step 1: Find next increment number

- Scan `.specweave/increments/` directory
- Find highest number (e.g., 002)
- Next increment: 003

### Step 2: Detect tech stack (CRITICAL - framework-agnostic)
   - Check `.specweave/config.yaml` for tech_stack configuration
   - If not found, detect from project files:
     - `package.json` ‚Üí TypeScript/JavaScript
     - `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` ‚Üí Python
     - `go.mod` ‚Üí Go
     - `Cargo.toml` ‚Üí Rust
     - `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` ‚Üí Java
     - `*.csproj` ‚Üí C#/.NET
   - Detect framework (NextJS, Django, FastAPI, Spring Boot, etc.)
   - If detection fails, ask user: "What language/framework are you using?"
   - Store detected tech stack for later use

### Step 3: Ask user for details

- "What would you like to build?" (get high-level description)
- "What's the short name?" (e.g., "user-authentication" for increment 003-user-authentication)
- "Priority? (P1/P2/P3)" (default: P1)

### Step 4: Activate role-orchestrator

- Analyze user's description
- Determine which strategic agents are needed:
  - pm-agent (product strategy)?
  - architect-agent (system design)?
  - devops-agent (infrastructure)?
  - security-agent (security review)?
  - qa-lead-agent (testing strategy)?

### Step 5: Ask clarifying questions (if needed)

- Target users/scale?
- Technology preferences? (if not detected)
- Budget constraints?
- Deployment platform?
- Payment processing needed?
- Authentication method?

### Step 6: Run strategic agents (with user approval)

- **Pass detected tech stack to ALL agents** (CRITICAL!)
- PM agent creates pm-analysis.md
- Architect agent creates architecture.md, ADRs (using detected tech stack)
- DevOps agent creates infrastructure.md (platform-specific)
- Security agent creates security.md (framework-specific security)
- QA agent creates test-strategy.md (framework-specific tests)

### Step 7: Present strategic docs for review

- Show summary of all strategic outputs
- Ask: "Review docs with /sync-docs or approve to continue?"
- Wait for user approval

### Step 8: Create spec.md (based on strategic docs)
   - Frontmatter with increment number, title, priority, status, dependencies
   - **Include detected tech stack in frontmatter** (see format below)
   - Overview section
   - Business value
   - User stories with acceptance tests
   - Functional requirements
   - Out of scope
   - Success criteria
   - Dependencies

### Step 9: Create tasks.md (task-builder skill)

**üéØ CRITICAL: Auto-generate tasks from plan.md**

- Analyze all strategic docs
- Break down into phases (framework-specific)
- Create tasks with:
  - Agent references (use framework-specific agents if available)
  - File paths (framework-specific paths: src/ for TS, app/ for Django, etc.)
  - Implementation snippets (framework-specific code)
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Documentation updates

### Step 10: Save increment

- Create `.specweave/increments/####-name/`
- Save spec.md
- Save tasks.md (auto-generated!)
- Save strategic docs (pm-analysis.md, architecture.md, etc.)

### Step 11: Output to user
    ```
    ‚úÖ Created increment 0003-user-authentication

       Detected tech stack:
       - Language: {detected-language} (e.g., Python, TypeScript, Go, Java)
       - Framework: {detected-framework} (e.g., Django, FastAPI, NextJS, Spring Boot)
       - Database: {specified-database} (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)
       - Platform: {specified-platform} (e.g., AWS, Hetzner, Vercel, self-hosted)

       Location: .specweave/increments/0003-user-authentication/

       üìã Files created:
       - spec.md (6 user stories, 15 requirements)
       - tasks.md (42 implementation tasks using {framework} patterns)
       - pm-analysis.md (product strategy)
       - architecture.md (system design for {framework})
       - infrastructure.md ({platform} deployment)
       - security.md ({framework}-specific security)
       - test-strategy.md (E2E tests for {framework})

       ‚è±Ô∏è  Estimated effort: 3-4 weeks

       Next steps:
       1. Review docs: /sync-docs
       2. Start implementation: Begin with Task T001 in tasks.md
       3. Sync to GitHub: /sync-github
    ```

## Frontmatter Format (spec.md):

**IMPORTANT**: Tech stack is DETECTED from `.specweave/config.yaml` or project files, NOT hardcoded!

```yaml
---
increment: 003-user-authentication
title: "User Authentication System"
priority: P1
status: planned
created: 2025-10-26
dependencies: []
structure: user-stories

# Tech stack is DETECTED, not hardcoded
tech_stack:
  detected_from: ".specweave/config.yaml"  # or "package.json", "requirements.txt", etc.
  language: "{detected-language}"          # e.g., "typescript", "python", "go", "java", "rust"
  framework: "{detected-framework}"        # e.g., "nextjs", "django", "fastapi", "spring-boot", "gin"
  database: "{specified-database}"         # e.g., "postgresql", "mysql", "mongodb", "sqlite"
  orm: "{detected-orm}"                    # e.g., "prisma", "django-orm", "sqlalchemy", "hibernate"

# Platform is SPECIFIED by user or detected from config
platform: "{specified-platform}"           # e.g., "hetzner", "aws", "vercel", "self-hosted"
estimated_cost: "{calculated-based-on-platform}"
---
```

**Example for TypeScript/NextJS project**:
```yaml
tech_stack:
  detected_from: "package.json"
  language: "typescript"
  framework: "nextjs"
  database: "postgresql"
  orm: "prisma"
platform: "vercel"
estimated_cost: "$20/month"
```

**Example for Python/Django project**:
```yaml
tech_stack:
  detected_from: "requirements.txt"
  language: "python"
  framework: "django"
  database: "postgresql"
  orm: "django-orm"
platform: "hetzner"
estimated_cost: "$12/month"
```

**Example for Go/Gin project**:
```yaml
tech_stack:
  detected_from: "go.mod"
  language: "go"
  framework: "gin"
  database: "postgresql"
  orm: "gorm"
platform: "aws"
estimated_cost: "$25/month"
```

## Frontmatter Format (tasks.md):

```yaml
---
increment: 003-event-booking-saas
status: planned
dependencies:
  - 001-skills-framework
  - 002-role-based-agents
phases:
  - infrastructure
  - backend
  - frontend
  - testing
  - deployment
estimated_tasks: 42
estimated_weeks: 3-4
---
```

## Autonomous Mode (Advanced):

If user says "autonomous mode" or "full automation":
1. Run all strategic agents
2. Create increment
3. **Start implementation immediately** (with permission)
4. Ask clarification questions only when critical
5. Suggest doc updates when needed
6. Complete full implementation autonomously

## Error Handling:

- If `.specweave/` not found: "Error: Not a SpecWeave project. Run specweave init first."
- If user description too vague: Ask more clarifying questions
- If strategic agents not available: "Warning: Some agents missing. Continue with basic spec?"

**Important**: This is the main entry point for creating new work in SpecWeave.
