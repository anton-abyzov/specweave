# Close GitHub Issue for Completed Increment

Close the GitHub issue associated with a completed SpecWeave increment.

## Usage

```bash
/specweave.github.close-issue <increment-id> [options]
```

## Arguments

- `increment-id`: Increment ID (e.g., `0004` or `0004-plugin-architecture`)

## Options

- `--force`: Force close even if increment not marked complete
- `--comment`: Custom closing comment (default: auto-generated summary)
- `--reopen`: Reopen a previously closed issue
- `--skip-validation`: Skip PM gate validation

## Examples

```bash
# Basic usage (auto-generates completion summary)
/specweave.github.close-issue 0004

# With custom comment
/specweave.github.close-issue 0004 --comment "Merged to main, deploying to production"

# Force close (skip validation)
/specweave.github.close-issue 0004 --force

# Reopen closed issue
/specweave.github.close-issue 0004 --reopen
```

Status: Closed
Closed at: 2025-10-30 17:00:00

Increment 0004 is complete! üéâ
```

### Validation Failure

```
‚ùå Cannot close issue: Validation failed

Increment 0004 is not yet complete:

Issues:
‚úó Tasks: 45/48 completed (3 remaining)
  - T-046: Update documentation
  - T-047: Run E2E tests
  - T-048: Final review

‚úó Tests: 2 tests failing
  - TC-105: Plugin unload test
  - TC-127: E2E sync test

‚úó PM Gates: Not run yet
  - Run /specweave.done 0004 first

Fix these issues, then retry:
  /specweave.github.close-issue 0004

Or force close (not recommended):
  /specweave.github.close-issue 0004 --force
```

## Requirements

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Increment marked as complete (via `/specweave.done`)
- Valid GitHub issue exists for increment

## Error Handling

**Increment not complete**:
```
‚ùå Error: Increment 0004 is not complete

Status: in_progress (should be: completed)

Complete the increment first:
  /specweave.done 0004

Then close the issue:
  /specweave.github.close-issue 0004
```

**Issue not found**:
```
‚ùå Error: No GitHub issue found for increment 0004

Check .metadata.yaml for issue number.

Create issue first:
  /specweave.github.create-issue 0004
```

**Issue already closed**:
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è  Issue #130 is already closed

Closed by: @developer1
Closed at: 2025-10-30 16:00:00

Use --reopen to reopen the issue.
```

**Permission denied**:
```
‚ùå Error: Insufficient permissions to close issue #130

Required: Write or Admin access to repository

Contact repository admin for access.
```

## Related Commands

- `/specweave.done <increment-id>`: Mark increment complete (run this first)
- `/specweave.github.sync <increment-id>`: Sync final progress before closing
- `/specweave.github.status <increment-id>`: Check issue status

## Tips

1. **Auto-Close**: Enable `auto_close_issue: true` for automatic closing when running `/specweave.done`

2. **Final Sync**: Always run `/specweave.github.sync` before closing to ensure latest progress is posted

3. **Validation**: Don't skip validation (`--force`) unless absolutely necessary - it ensures quality

4. **Custom Comments**: Use `--comment` for release-specific notes (deployment status, known issues, etc.)

5. **Reopening**: If increment needs more work after closing, use `--reopen` to reopen the issue

      closing_conditions:
        # Require all tests passing
        - type: "tests"

          required: true

        # Require coverage >= 80%
        - type: "coverage"

          required: true

        # Require PR merged

```

### Post-Closing Actions

Trigger actions after closing:

# Close specific increments
for i in 0004 0005 0006; do
  /specweave.github.close-issue $i
done
```

### Reopen with Context

Reopen issue with explanation:

```bash
/specweave.github.close-issue 0004 --reopen \
  --comment "Reopening: Critical bug found in production (issue #140). Need to add rollback mechanism."
```
