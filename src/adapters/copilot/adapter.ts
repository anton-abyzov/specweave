================================================================
      GitHub Copilot Adapter - Basic Automation
================================================================

Your project is now configured for GitHub Copilot!

WHAT THIS PROVIDES:

- AGENTS.md (Universal Standard)
  - Copilot automatically reads this file
  - Contains all workflow instructions
  - Project structure and templates
  - Following agents.md standard (https://agents.md/)

- Better Code Suggestions
  - Copilot reads AGENTS.md for context
  - Suggests code following SpecWeave patterns
  - Understands project structure

UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENCE:

Claude Code (Full Automation):
- Native skills (auto-activate)
- Native agents (separate context windows)
- Native hooks (auto-update docs)
- Slash commands (/inc, /do, /done)

Cursor (Semi-Automation):
- Reads AGENTS.md for workflow
- @ context shortcuts
- Composer multi-file editing

Copilot (Basic Automation - This Adapter):
- Reads AGENTS.md automatically
- Better code suggestions
- No skills, agents, hooks, or commands
- Manual workflow with AI assistance

HOW COPILOT USES AGENTS.MD:

GitHub Copilot automatically reads AGENTS.md to understand:
- SpecWeave structure (.specweave/ folders)
- File naming conventions (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md)
- Context manifests (what files to reference)
- Best practices (technology-agnostic specs, etc.)

Result: Copilot suggests code that fits SpecWeave patterns!

HOW TO USE SPECWEAVE WITH COPILOT:

1. Copilot reads AGENTS.md automatically
   - No action needed - just open project in VS Code
   - Copilot will suggest code following SpecWeave patterns

2. Create increments manually:
   mkdir -p .specweave/increments/0001-user-auth

3. Reference context manifests:
   Open context-manifest.yaml
   â†’ Copilot sees which files are relevant
   â†’ Provides better suggestions

4. Ask Copilot Chat for guidance:
   "How do I create a spec.md following SpecWeave?"
   "Generate plan.md for user authentication"
   "What should go in context-manifest.yaml?"

5. Use Copilot inline suggestions:
   Start typing in spec.md â†’ Copilot suggests content
   Following SpecWeave patterns from AGENTS.md

WORKFLOW EXAMPLE:

Creating a Feature:

1. Create increment folder:
   mkdir -p .specweave/increments/0002-payments
   cd .specweave/increments/0002-payments

2. Create spec.md:
   - Open file, start typing frontmatter
   - Copilot suggests SpecWeave structure (from AGENTS.md)
   - Fill in user stories, acceptance criteria

3. Create plan.md:
   - Reference spec.md (Copilot reads it)
   - Start typing "# Technical Plan"
   - Copilot suggests architecture sections

4. Create context-manifest.yaml:
   - Copilot suggests relevant files to include
   - Lists spec sections and architecture docs

LIMITATIONS (vs Claude Code & Cursor):

- No auto-activation or workflows
- No skills, agents, hooks
- No slash commands or @ shortcuts
- No role-based assistance (PM, Architect, etc.)
- Completely manual workflow

But Copilot still provides helpful suggestions!
- Understands SpecWeave structure from AGENTS.md
- Suggests code following project patterns

DOCUMENTATION:

- AGENTS.md: Universal workflow instructions (Copilot reads this!)
- .specweave/docs/: Project documentation

You're ready to build with SpecWeave on GitHub Copilot!

Note: For better automation, consider Claude Code (full) or Cursor (semi).
Copilot is best for simple projects or when already using VS Code + Copilot.
