## The Problem Everyone Feels But Nobody Talks About

Your AI coding assistant writes features in 30 minutes.

You spend 3 days updating documentation.

By day 4, the code has changed again.

**The docs? Already wrong.**

---

## The Dirty Secret of AI Coding

AI coding assistants made us:
- ✅ **10x faster at shipping**
- ❌ **100x worse at maintaining**

We're all "vibe coding" now. Fast. Fun. Chaotic.

No structure. No boundaries. No memory of why we built it this way.

New developers? Lost in 1 hour.

**This is not sustainable.**

---

## The Fortune 500 Gap

Big companies don't have this problem.

They have systems:
- **PRDs** (Product Requirements) - What and why
- **HLDs** (High-Level Design) - Architecture decisions
- **ADRs** (Architecture Decision Records) - Why we chose X over Y
- **Runbooks** (Operations) - How to actually run this
- **Glossaries** (Terms) - What these acronyms mean

Their docs stay updated because there's a team, a process, a **discipline**.

But for solo developers and small teams?

**Impossible to maintain manually.**

---

## What is SpecWeave?

**Fortune 500 discipline. Zero overhead. AI-native.**

SpecWeave is a spec-driven development framework that brings enterprise-grade processes to developers of any size—without the bureaucracy.

It's not just a tool. **It's a movement.**

> *"Dad, AI writes your code but you update docs MANUALLY?"*
> — My 14-year-old daughter (who was absolutely right)

**The new way:**
- Living docs that ACTUALLY stay synced (automatically)
- Complete knowledge system (PRDs, HLDs, ADRs, glossaries, runbooks)
- Tests embedded in tasks (BDD format, full traceability)
- Enterprise structure without enterprise overhead
- **Vibe coding... but with boundaries**

---

## What Changes

**BEFORE (Vibe Coding):**
- "I think we used JWT tokens?"
- "Why did we choose PostgreSQL again?"
- "What does this acronym mean?"
- New developer: **Lost in 1 hour**

**AFTER (SpecWeave):**
- Check ADR-003: JWT vs Session Tokens (we chose JWT, here's why)
- Check HLD: Database section (Postgres for ACID compliance)
- Check Glossary: All technical terms defined
- New developer: **Productive in 1 hour**

## Enterprise Features

### 🏢 Multi-Project Support (v0.8.0+)

Organize documentation by team, repo, or microservice:

- **Team-Based Organization**: Frontend, Backend, Mobile, Platform teams with separate documentation
- **Microservices Architecture**: Each service gets its own specs, modules, and team playbooks
- **Per-Project Sync**: Link projects to different GitHub repos, JIRA projects, or ADO boards
- **Unified Architecture**: Single project = multi-project with 1 project (NO special cases!)

**Five Documentation Types Per Project**:
1. **specs/** - Living documentation specs (user stories, AC)
2. **modules/** - Module/component documentation (architecture, APIs)
3. **team/** - Team playbooks (onboarding, conventions, workflows)
4. **architecture/** - Project-specific ADRs (optional)
5. **legacy/** - Brownfield imports (temporary)

**[→ Multi-Project Setup Guide](https://spec-weave.com/docs/guides/multi-project-setup)**

### 📦 Brownfield Import

Import existing documentation from external sources:

- **Automatic Classification**: AI-powered keyword detection (85%+ accuracy)
- **Supported Sources**: Notion, Confluence, GitHub Wiki, custom markdown folders
- **Smart Organization**: Classifies into specs, modules, team docs, or legacy
- **Migration Reports**: Complete audit trail with confidence scores and manual review checklist

**Example**:
```bash
# Import Notion export to web-app project
/specweave:import-docs ~/Downloads/notion-export --source=notion --project=web-app

# Result:
# ✅ Classified 127 files
#    - 37 specs → projects/web-app/specs/
#    - 18 modules → projects/web-app/modules/
#    - 12 team docs → projects/web-app/team/
#    - 60 legacy → projects/web-app/legacy/notion/
```
