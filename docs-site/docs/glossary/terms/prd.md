# PRD (Product Requirements Document)

**Category**: Planning & Requirements

## Definition

**PRD** (Product Requirements Document) is a strategic document that articulates the business case, user needs, and product vision for a feature or product. PRDs answer the **"why"** before diving into **"what"** (spec) or **"how"** (design).

**Purpose**: Align stakeholders on business value, user problems, and success criteria before implementation.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

**The "Why Are We Building This?" Problem**:
- ❌ Teams build features without clear business rationale
- ❌ Stakeholders have different expectations (misalignment)
- ❌ No success criteria (how do we know it worked?)
- ❌ Resources wasted on low-value features

**PRD Solution**:
- ✅ Clear business case (why invest time/money?)
- ✅ Shared understanding (all stakeholders aligned)
- ✅ Success metrics defined (measure impact)
- ✅ Prioritization framework (build high-value features first)
