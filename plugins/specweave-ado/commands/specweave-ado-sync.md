# Sync ADO Work Item Command

**Usage**: `/specweave-ado:sync <increment-id> [options]`

**Purpose**: Two-way synchronization between SpecWeave increment and Azure DevOps work item

**Default**: Two-way sync (push & pull)

---

## Options

- `--direction <mode>`: Sync direction (default: `two-way`)
  - `two-way`: SpecWeave ↔ ADO (default - recommended)
  - `to-ado`: SpecWeave → ADO only (push progress)
  - `from-ado`: ADO → SpecWeave only (pull updates)

## Examples

```bash
# Two-way sync (default - both directions)
/specweave-ado:sync 0005

# Push only (one-way to ADO)
/specweave-ado:sync 0005 --direction to-ado

# Pull only (one-way from ADO)
/specweave-ado:sync 0005 --direction from-ado
```

## Command Behavior

When user runs this command, invoke `ado-manager` agent to perform two-way sync:

### Phase 1: Pull FROM ADO (default behavior)
1. Fetch work item state from ADO API
2. Detect changes in ADO:
   - State changes (New → Active → Resolved → Closed)
   - Priority changes
   - Iteration/sprint changes
   - Comments from team members
   - Field updates
3. Apply ADO changes to SpecWeave increment:
   - Update increment status to match ADO state
   - Update priority in metadata
   - Import team comments to increment notes
   - Update iteration tracking

### Phase 2: Push TO ADO (default behavior)
1. Read tasks.md from increment
2. Calculate completion percentage
3. Identify recently completed tasks
4. Format progress update comment
5. POST comment to ADO work item
6. Update work item state if needed (New → Active → Resolved)
7. Update custom fields (completion %, current task, etc.)

**Agent Invocation**:
```
Use Task tool with subagent_type: "specweave-ado:ado-manager:ado-manager"

Prompt: "Two-way sync for increment 0005-payment-integration with ADO.

Phase 1 - Pull FROM ADO:
1. Fetch work item #12345 from ADO API
2. Detect changes: state, priority, iteration, comments
3. Apply ADO changes to increment metadata
4. Import team comments to increment notes

Phase 2 - Push TO ADO:
1. Read .specweave/increments/0005/tasks.md
2. Calculate: X/Y tasks complete (Z%)
3. Identify: Recently completed tasks
4. Format comment with progress update
5. Load work item ID from increment-metadata.json
6. POST comment to ADO API
7. Update work item state/fields
