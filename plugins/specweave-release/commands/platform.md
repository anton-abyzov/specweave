# Platform Release Coordination

**Purpose**: Orchestrate releases across multiple repositories as a unified platform version.

**When to Use**: Multi-repo architectures where services must release together (umbrella versioning).

---

## Commands

### Create Platform RC

```bash
/sw-release:platform create <platform-version>
```

**Example**:
```bash
/sw-release:platform create v3.0.0
```

**What it does**:
1. Validates all repos have clean working directories
2. Creates `release/v*` branches in all repos (GitFlow)
3. Aligns versions across repos (using semantic versioning)
4. Tags RC.1 in all repos: `v5.0.0-rc.1`, `v2.9.0-rc.1`, etc.
5. Updates platform manifest: `.specweave/platform-releases.json`
6. Creates version matrix: `.specweave/docs/internal/delivery/version-matrix.md`

**Output**:
```
🚀 Creating Platform Release: v3.0.0

Step 1: Validating repositories...
   ✓ frontend: Clean (current: v4.2.0)
   ✓ backend: Clean (current: v2.8.0)
   ✓ api-gateway: Clean (current: v3.1.0)

Step 2: Analyzing changes...
   📊 frontend: 12 commits (3 breaking, 5 features, 4 fixes) → Suggest v5.0.0
   📊 backend: 8 commits (0 breaking, 7 features, 1 fix) → Suggest v2.9.0
   📊 api-gateway: 15 commits (2 breaking, 8 features, 5 fixes) → Suggest v4.0.0

Step 3: Creating release branches...
   ✓ frontend: release/v5.0.0
   ✓ backend: release/v2.9.0
   ✓ api-gateway: release/v4.0.0

Step 4: Tagging RC.1...
   ✓ frontend: v5.0.0-rc.1
   ✓ backend: v2.9.0-rc.1
   ✓ api-gateway: v4.0.0-rc.1

Step 5: Updating platform manifest...
   ✓ Created .specweave/platform-releases.json

Step 6: Updating version matrix...
   ✓ Created .specweave/docs/internal/delivery/version-matrix.md

✅ Platform v3.0.0-rc.1 created!

Next steps:
1. Deploy to staging
2. Run E2E tests
3. If tests pass: /sw-release:platform promote v3.0.0-rc.1
4. If tests fail: /sw-release:platform iterate v3.0.0-rc.1
```

---

### Iterate Platform RC

```bash
/sw-release:platform iterate <platform-rc-version>
```

**Example**:
```bash
/sw-release:platform iterate v3.0.0-rc.1
```

**What it does**:
1. Identifies which repos need fixes
2. Bumps RC number (rc.1 → rc.2)
3. Tags new RC in affected repos only
4. Updates platform manifest

**Output**:
```
🔄 Iterating Platform RC: v3.0.0-rc.1

Which repos need fixes?
[x] frontend
[ ] backend (no changes needed)
[x] api-gateway

Creating RC.2 for changed repos:
   ✓ frontend: v5.0.0-rc.2
   ✓ api-gateway: v4.0.0-rc.2
   ℹ️  backend: v2.9.0-rc.1 (unchanged)

✅ Platform v3.0.0-rc.2 created!
```

---

### Promote Platform RC to Production

```bash
/sw-release:platform promote <platform-rc-version>
```

**Example**:
```bash
/sw-release:platform promote v3.0.0-rc.3
```

**What it does**:
1. Validates all RCs passed tests
2. Merges release branches to main (GitFlow)
3. Tags final versions (removes -rc.N suffix)
4. Merges main back to develop (GitFlow)
5. Deletes release branches (optional)
6. Updates platform manifest with "released" status
7. Updates version matrix
8. Tracks DORA metrics

**Pre-Flight Checklist**:
- ✅ All E2E tests passing
- ✅ Performance benchmarks met
- ✅ Security scan clean
- ✅ Stakeholder approval received
- ✅ Canary deployment successful (if applicable)

**Output**:
```
🎉 Promoting Platform RC to Production: v3.0.0-rc.3

Pre-Flight Checks:
   ✓ All repos on latest RC
   ✓ Tests passing: frontend ✅, backend ✅, api-gateway ✅
   ✓ No blocking issues

Step 1: Merging to main...
   ✓ frontend: release/v5.0.0 → main
   ✓ backend: release/v2.9.0 → main
   ✓ api-gateway: release/v4.0.0 → main

Step 2: Tagging final versions...
   ✓ frontend: v5.0.0
   ✓ backend: v2.9.0
   ✓ api-gateway: v4.0.0

Step 3: Merging back to develop...
   ✓ frontend: main → develop
   ✓ backend: main → develop
   ✓ api-gateway: main → develop

Step 4: Cleaning up release branches...
   ✓ frontend: Deleted release/v5.0.0
   ✓ backend: Deleted release/v2.9.0
   ✓ api-gateway: Deleted release/v4.0.0

Step 5: Updating platform manifest...
   ✓ Status: released

Step 6: Tracking DORA metrics...
   ✓ Deployment frequency updated
   ✓ Lead time calculated
   ✓ Dashboard updated

✅ Platform v3.0.0 released to production!

## Best Practices

**When to Use Platform Releases**:
- ✅ Services have tight coupling (breaking changes affect multiple repos)
- ✅ Product milestones important (v3.0.0 marketing launch)
- ✅ Need coordinated testing (E2E tests span services)
- ✅ Compliance requirements (audit trail for version combinations)

**When NOT to Use**:
- ❌ Services are fully independent (no coupling)
- ❌ Different release cadences (frontend weekly, backend monthly)
- ❌ Large number of services (>10 repos - use independent versioning)

**RC Best Practices**:
- Create RC.1 early (at least 1 week before planned release)
- Limit RC iterations (ideally ≤3, if >5 something is wrong)
- Test cross-service integration thoroughly
- Document all changes between RCs

---

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Git conflicts during merge
```bash
# Solution: Resolve conflicts manually, then resume
git add .
git commit -m "Resolved conflicts"
/sw-release:platform promote v3.0.0-rc.3 --resume
```

**Issue**: One service fails tests
```bash
# Solution: Fix the service, create new RC
# (Don't bump other services that passed)
/sw-release:platform iterate v3.0.0-rc.2
```

**Issue**: Need to rollback
```bash
# Solution: Revert main to previous tag, create hotfix
git revert <commit>
/sw-release:platform create v3.0.1
```

**Note**: This command integrates with existing SpecWeave increment workflow. Each platform release should have its own increment (e.g., `0050-platform-v3-release`).
