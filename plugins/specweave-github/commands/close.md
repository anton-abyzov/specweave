# Close GitHub Issue for Completed Increment

Close the GitHub issue associated with a completed SpecWeave increment.

## ⛔ MANDATORY: Sync Living Docs BEFORE Closing

**GitHub issue content is generated FROM living docs.** If living docs are stale, the closing summary will have outdated information.

**You MUST run `/sw:sync-specs` BEFORE closing (unless using /sw:sync-progress):**

```bash
# STEP 1: Ensure living docs reflect final state
/sw:sync-specs <increment-id>

# STEP 2: Then close GitHub issue
/sw-github:close <increment-id>
```

**Why?**
- Closing comment includes final stats from living docs
- User story completion status read from living docs
- AC checkboxes reflect living docs state

**Note:** `/sw:done` and `/sw:sync-progress` call sync-specs automatically.

---

**Usage**: `/sw-github:close <increment-id>`

```bash
/sw:github:close-issue <increment-id> [options]
```

## Arguments

- `increment-id`: Increment ID (e.g., `0004` or `0004-plugin-architecture`)

## Options

- `--force`: Force close even if increment not marked complete
- `--comment`: Custom closing comment (default: auto-generated summary)
- `--reopen`: Reopen a previously closed issue
- `--skip-validation`: Skip PM gate validation

## Examples

```bash
# Basic usage (auto-generates completion summary)
/sw:github:close-issue 0004

# With custom comment
/sw:github:close-issue 0004 --comment "Merged to main, deploying to production"

# Force close (skip validation)
/sw:github:close-issue 0004 --force

# Reopen closed issue
/sw:github:close-issue 0004 --reopen
```

### Validation Failure

```
❌ Cannot close issue: Validation failed

Increment 0004 is not yet complete:

Issues:
✗ Tasks: 45/48 completed (3 remaining)
  - T-046: Update documentation
  - T-047: Run E2E tests
  - T-048: Final review

✗ Tests: 2 tests failing
  - TC-105: Plugin unload test
  - TC-127: E2E sync test

✗ PM Gates: Not run yet
  - Run /sw:done 0004 first

Fix these issues, then retry:
  /sw:github:close-issue 0004

Or force close (not recommended):
  /sw:github:close-issue 0004 --force
```

## Requirements

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Increment marked as complete (via `/sw:done`)
- Valid GitHub issue exists for increment

## Error Handling

**Increment not complete**:
```
❌ Error: Increment 0004 is not complete

Status: in_progress (should be: completed)

Complete the increment first:
  /sw:done 0004

Then close the issue:
  /sw:github:close-issue 0004
```

**Issue not found**:
```
❌ Error: No GitHub issue found for increment 0004

Check .metadata.yaml for issue number.

Create issue first:
  /sw:github:create-issue 0004
```

**Issue already closed**:
```
ℹ️  Issue #130 is already closed

Closed by: @developer1
Closed at: 2025-10-30 16:00:00

Use --reopen to reopen the issue.
```

**Permission denied**:
```
❌ Error: Insufficient permissions to close issue #130

Required: Write or Admin access to repository

Contact repository admin for access.
```

## Related Commands

- `/sw:done <increment-id>`: Mark increment complete (run this first)
- `/sw:github:sync <increment-id>`: Sync final progress before closing
- `/sw:github:status <increment-id>`: Check issue status

## Tips

1. **Auto-Close**: Enable `auto_close_issue: true` for automatic closing when running `/sw:done`

2. **Final Sync**: Always run `/sw:github:sync` before closing to ensure latest progress is posted

3. **Validation**: Don't skip validation (`--force`) unless absolutely necessary - it ensures quality

4. **Custom Comments**: Use `--comment` for release-specific notes (deployment status, known issues, etc.)

5. **Reopening**: If increment needs more work after closing, use `--reopen` to reopen the issue
