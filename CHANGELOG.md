## [0.1.5] - 2025-10-28

### 🔥 **MAJOR CHANGE: All Components Pre-Installed!**

**Strategic reversal**: We're pre-installing ALL agents and skills instead of auto-installing on-demand.

#### Why This Change?

**OLD approach (0.1.0-0.1.4)**: "Just-in-time auto-installation"
- Empty `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/skills/` folders
- Components install automatically when you describe your project
- Marketed as "killer feature"

**Problems discovered**:
- User confusion: "Why are folders empty?"
- Unclear UX: "Do I need to install something?"
- Unnecessary complexity for a simple use case

**NEW approach (0.1.5+)**: "Everything ready out of the box"
- ALL 10 agents pre-installed
- ALL 35+ skills pre-installed
- Ready to use immediately
- No auto-installation logic needed

#### What's Changed

**1. `specweave init` now copies ALL components**:

```bash
specweave init my-project

# Creates:
.claude/
├── agents/      # 10 agents copied (PM, Architect, Security, QA, DevOps, Tech Lead, SRE, Docs Writer, Performance, Diagrams Architect)
├── skills/      # 35+ skills copied (Node.js, Python, Next.js, React, etc.)
└── commands/    # 10 slash commands copied
```

**2. Updated all documentation**:
- ✅ README.md: "All components pre-installed"
- ✅ CLAUDE.md: Removed auto-install references
- ✅ CLI output: Shows pre-installed component counts

**3. Simplified mental model**:
- **Before**: "Describe project → Components auto-install → Start building"
- **After**: "Run init → All ready → Describe project → Start building"

#### Benefits

✅ **Clearer UX**: No confusion about empty folders
✅ **Faster starts**: No installation wait time
✅ **Simpler architecture**: No auto-install detection logic
✅ **Predictable**: Same components every time
✅ **Offline-friendly**: All components local after init

#### Trade-offs

⚠️ **Larger package**: ~1.7MB (includes all agents/skills)
⚠️ **More disk usage**: ~5-10MB per project (vs empty folders)

But these trade-offs are acceptable for the dramatically improved UX!

├── README.md                    # Minimal project readme
└── .gitignore
```

**All ready to go! Just describe your project.** 🚀

### Migration from 0.1.4

If you're on 0.1.4 with empty folders:

```bash
# Upgrade
npm update -g specweave

# Re-run init to populate folders
cd your-project
rm -rf .claude
specweave init --skip-existing
```

---

### Summary

- 🔄 **Strategic reversal**: From auto-install to pre-install
- ✅ **10 agents** ready immediately
- ✅ **35+ skills** ready immediately
- ✅ **Clearer UX** for users
- ✅ **Simpler architecture** for maintainers

**This is the right approach for SpecWeave moving forward!**
