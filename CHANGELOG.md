## [0.1.6] - 2025-10-28

### ✨ **Command Aliases & Roadmap Improvements**

Major UX improvement: Short, memorable command aliases based on Agile terminology.

### 🚀 **NEW: Command Aliases**

**Problem**: Typing `/create-increment` repeatedly during development is tedious.

**Solution**: Short, domain-specific aliases!

| Full Command | Alias | Meaning |
|--------------|-------|---------|
| `/create-project` | `/init` | Initialize project |
| `/create-increment` | `/pi` | **Plan Product Increment** |
| `/start-increment` | `/si` | Start increment |
| `/add-tasks` | `/at` | Add tasks |
| `/validate-increment` | `/vi` | Validate increment |
| `/close-increment` | `/done` | Close increment |
| `/list-increments` | `/ls` | List increments |

**Why `/pi`?**
- **PI = Product Increment** (standard Agile/Scrum terminology)
- Aligns with PI Planning (Program Increment in SAFe framework)
- Domain-specific and memorable
- Avoids confusion with CI/CD

**Typical workflow**:
```bash
/init my-saas              # Initialize
/pi "User authentication"  # Plan Product Increment
/si 0001                   # Start
/at 0001 "Add tests"       # Add tasks
/vi 0001 --quality         # Validate
/done 0001                 # Close
```

**Benefits**:
- 🚀 **50-70% fewer keystrokes** for common commands
- 💪 **Memorable aliases** based on Agile terminology
- 📖 **Full commands still work** for scripts and documentation

### 📋 **Roadmap Policy Update**

**NEW RULE: Never plan more than 1 version ahead!**

**Why?**
- ✅ Prevents over-commitment and disappointment
- ✅ Allows flexibility based on user feedback
- ✅ Focuses team on immediate next milestone
- ✅ Avoids obsolete promises as product evolves

**Updated Roadmap**:
- ✅ **Current**: v0.1.6 (this release)
- ✅ **Next**: v0.2.0 (Q2 2025) - Quality, Testing, Context
- ❌ **Removed**: v0.3.0, v1.0.0, and all far-future versions

**After v0.2.0 ships** → Define v0.3.0 (not before!)

### 🐛 **Bug Fixes**

#### What's Fixed

**1. `specweave-detector` skill - Major cleanup**:
- ❌ Removed outdated auto-installation references (lines 36-175)
- ❌ Removed "Just-In-Time Component Installation" section
- ❌ Removed auto-installation component mapping
- ❌ Removed installation commands: `npx specweave install spec-author`
- ✅ Updated all examples to show pre-installed components
- ✅ Enhanced YAML description with activation keywords
- ✅ Updated Skill Discovery section (comprehensive pre-installed list)
- ✅ Fixed all path references: `features/` → `.specweave/increments/`
- ✅ Fixed all naming: "Feature 00X" → "Increment 000X"
- ✅ Updated config example (removed `auto_install` setting)

**2. README.md - npm package documentation**:
- ✅ Updated version badge: `0.1.0-beta.1` → `0.1.5`
- ✅ Added spec-weave.com website links throughout
- ✅ Removed ALL auto-installation and dynamic loading references
- ✅ Updated component counts: 19 agents → 10 agents, 24 skills → 35+ skills
- ✅ Updated Quick Example to emphasize pre-installation
- ✅ Removed entire "Context Precision (70%+ reduction)" section
- ✅ Updated comparisons to BMAD-METHOD and spec-kit
- ✅ Updated all GitHub URLs: `specweave/specweave` → `anton-abyzov/specweave`
- ✅ Simplified documentation section with spec-weave.com links

#### Why This Matters

These fixes ensure **complete consistency** with the 0.1.5 pre-installation approach:
- No confusing references to auto-installation
- Accurate activation triggers for skills
- Clear examples showing pre-installed components
- Professional npm package documentation

#### User Impact

✅ **SpecWeave activation now works correctly** - `specweave-detector` has proper keywords
✅ **npm package page is accurate** - shows correct features and approach
✅ **No more confusion** - all documentation aligned with pre-installation

## [0.1.5] - 2025-10-28

### 🔥 **MAJOR CHANGE: All Components Pre-Installed!**

**Strategic reversal**: We're pre-installing ALL agents and skills instead of auto-installing on-demand.

#### Why This Change?

**OLD approach (0.1.0-0.1.4)**: "Just-in-time auto-installation"
- Empty `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/skills/` folders
- Components install automatically when you describe your project
- Marketed as "killer feature"

**Problems discovered**:
- User confusion: "Why are folders empty?"
- Unclear UX: "Do I need to install something?"
- Unnecessary complexity for a simple use case

**NEW approach (0.1.5+)**: "Everything ready out of the box"
- ALL 10 agents pre-installed
- ALL 35+ skills pre-installed
- Ready to use immediately
- No auto-installation logic needed

#### What's Changed

**1. `specweave init` now copies ALL components**:

```bash
specweave init my-project

# Creates:
.claude/
├── agents/      # 10 agents copied (PM, Architect, Security, QA, DevOps, Tech Lead, SRE, Docs Writer, Performance, Diagrams Architect)
├── skills/      # 35+ skills copied (Node.js, Python, Next.js, React, etc.)
└── commands/    # 10 slash commands copied
```

**2. Updated all documentation**:
- ✅ README.md: "All components pre-installed"
- ✅ CLAUDE.md: Removed auto-install references
- ✅ CLI output: Shows pre-installed component counts

**3. Simplified mental model**:
- **Before**: "Describe project → Components auto-install → Start building"
- **After**: "Run init → All ready → Describe project → Start building"

#### Benefits

✅ **Clearer UX**: No confusion about empty folders
✅ **Faster starts**: No installation wait time
✅ **Simpler architecture**: No auto-install detection logic
✅ **Predictable**: Same components every time
✅ **Offline-friendly**: All components local after init

#### Trade-offs

⚠️ **Larger package**: ~1.7MB (includes all agents/skills)
⚠️ **More disk usage**: ~5-10MB per project (vs empty folders)

But these trade-offs are acceptable for the dramatically improved UX!

```

**All ready to go! Just describe your project.** 🚀

### Migration from 0.1.4

If you're on 0.1.4 with empty folders:

```bash
# Upgrade
npm update -g specweave

# Re-run init to populate folders
cd your-project
rm -rf .claude
specweave init --skip-existing
```

---

### Summary

- 🔄 **Strategic reversal**: From auto-install to pre-install
- ✅ **10 agents** ready immediately
- ✅ **35+ skills** ready immediately
- ✅ **Clearer UX** for users
- ✅ **Simpler architecture** for maintainers

**This is the right approach for SpecWeave moving forward!**
