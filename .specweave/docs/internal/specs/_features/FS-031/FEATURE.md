# External Tool Status Synchronization

## Overview

Enhance SpecWeave's external tool integration (GitHub, JIRA, Azure DevOps) with bidirectional status synchronization, rich content sync, and task-level traceability. This addresses critical gaps identified in user feedback (GitHub Issue #37) where external issues show only file references instead of full content, and status changes don't sync automatically.

## Source

This feature was created from increment: [`0031-external-tool-status-sync`](../../../../../increments/0031-external-tool-status-sync)

## Business Value

- Eliminate Manual Work: Save 5-10 minutes per increment by automating status updates
- Complete Visibility: Stakeholders see full context in external tools without navigating to repository
- Perfect Traceability: Answer "Which increment implemented US-001?" instantly

## Projects

This feature spans the following projects:
