# FS-25-11-09-strict-increment-discipline-enforcement: Strict Increment Discipline Enforcement

Implement mandatory pre-flight checks to prevent multiple active increments and enforce the iron rule: **Cannot start increment N+1 until increment N is DONE**.

**Core Value**: Prevent framework integrity violations by enforcing discipline at the CLI level, not just documentation level.
