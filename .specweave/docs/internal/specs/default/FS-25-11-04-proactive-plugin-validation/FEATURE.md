# FS-25-11-04-proactive-plugin-validation: Proactive Plugin Validation System

Implement a comprehensive plugin validation system that proactively checks and installs required SpecWeave plugins BEFORE any workflow command executes. This ensures seamless environment migration (local → VM → Cloud IDE) and prevents cryptic errors from missing plugins.
