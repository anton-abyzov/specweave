# Operations Documentation - The "How We Run"

**Purpose**: Define how we operate, monitor, and maintain the system in production.

## What Goes Here

- **SLOs/SLIs** - Service Level Objectives and Indicators
- **Runbooks** - Step-by-step operational procedures
- **Monitoring & Alerting** - What to monitor, alert thresholds
- **Incident Response** - How to handle incidents
- **On-Call Procedures** - Rotation, escalation
- **Capacity Planning** - Resource forecasting, scaling
- **DR/BCP** - Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity Plans
- **Cost Management** - Budget, cost optimization

## Document Types

### Runbook
**Purpose**: Step-by-step procedures for operational tasks

**Template**: See `templates/docs/runbook-template.md`

**Sections**:
- **Service Overview** - What is this service?
- **SLOs / SLIs** - Performance targets
- **Dashboards & Alerts** - Where to find monitoring
- **Common Failures & Diagnostics** - Known issues, how to diagnose
- **Step-by-step Procedures** - How to perform tasks
- **Escalation & Ownership** - Who to contact
- **DR / Backup / Restore** - How to recover

**Naming**: `runbook-{service}.md`

**Example**: `runbook-api-server.md`, `runbook-database.md`

### SLO Definition
**Purpose**: Define service level objectives

**Sections**:
- **Service** - What service is this for?
- **SLI** - What are we measuring? (latency, availability, throughput)
- **SLO Target** - What's the goal? (99.9% uptime, p95 latency <200ms)
- **Measurement** - How do we measure it?
- **Alerting** - When to alert?

**Naming**: `slo-{service}.md`

**Example**: `slo-api-availability.md`, `slo-search-latency.md`

### Incident Response Playbook
**Purpose**: How to handle incidents

**Sections**:
- **Incident Severity Levels** - P1, P2, P3 definitions
- **Response Procedures** - Step-by-step for each severity
- **Communication Plan** - Who to notify, how
- **Post-Incident Review** - How to conduct retrospectives

**File**: `incident-response.md`

### DR/BCP Plan
**Purpose**: Disaster recovery and business continuity

**Sections**:
- **Recovery Objectives** - RTO (Recovery Time Objective), RPO (Recovery Point Objective)
- **Backup Strategy** - What's backed up, frequency
- **Restore Procedures** - Step-by-step recovery
- **Failover Plan** - How to switch to backup systems
