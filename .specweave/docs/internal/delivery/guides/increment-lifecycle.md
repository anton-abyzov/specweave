## Status Progression

### 5 Lifecycle Stages

```
backlog → planned → in-progress → completed → closed
   ↓         ↓          ↓             ↓          ↓
 Idea    Ready to   Work      All done    Archived
         start      ongoing   & tested    & reviewed
```

### Status Definitions

| Status | Definition | Location | Criteria |
|--------|------------|----------|----------|
| **backlog** | Idea identified, not yet planned | `.specweave/increments/_backlog/0001-name.md` | Basic idea documented |
| **planned** | Spec created, ready to start | `.specweave/increments/0001-name/` | spec.md + tasks.md created, dependencies identified |
| **in-progress** | Active development | Same location | ≥1 task started, WIP limit not exceeded |
| **completed** | All P1 tasks done, tests passing | Same location | All P1 tasks complete, tests pass, docs updated |
| **closed** | Reviewed, archived, WIP freed | Same location | Closure report generated, leftovers transferred |

### Lifecycle State Progression

```

## Backlog Management

### What is the Backlog?

The `_backlog` folder (`.specweave/increments/_backlog/`) is where you **capture ideas before full planning**.

**Purpose**:
- ✅ Capture feature ideas quickly without blocking current work
- ✅ Store ideas when WIP limit is reached
- ✅ Allow PM-led analysis before committing to full increment
- ✅ Keep increment folder clean (only planned/active work)

**Location**: `.specweave/increments/_backlog/####-feature-name.md`

### Backlog Item Structure

**Simple markdown file** with basic information:

```markdown
# Feature Name - Backlog Item

**Status**: backlog
**Priority**: P1/P2/P3
**Estimate**: Days/weeks
**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

[1-3 paragraphs describing the idea]

## Key Components

[Bullet points of main parts]

## User Value

**Problem**: [What problem does this solve?]

**Solution**: [High-level solution approach]

## Dependencies

**Blocked By**: [Other increments that must complete first]

**Requires**: [External resources, tools, services]

## When to Prioritize

**Start this increment when**:
1. [Condition 1]
2. [Condition 2]
3. [Condition 3]

**Estimated Impact**: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW

## Next Steps

When ready to start:
1. Close current in-progress increments (free WIP slot)
2. Run `/inc "Feature Name"` to promote to full increment
3. PM Agent will create complete spec.md + plan.md + tasks.md
```

### Workflow Diagram: Backlog → Increment

```
User Idea
    ↓
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Question: Can we start immediately?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    ↓                           ↓
YES (WIP < limit)          NO (WIP at limit)
    ↓                           ↓
/inc "feature"         Add to backlog
    ↓                           ↓
PM creates           Save as markdown:
full increment       _backlog/####-name.md
    ↓                           ↓
Start work           [Wait for WIP slot]
                                ↓
                    When ready (WIP freed)
                                ↓
                    Promote to increment:
                    /inc "feature name"
                                ↓
                    PM creates full increment
                                ↓
                    Start work
```

### Example Workflows

#### Example 1: Add Idea to Backlog (WIP at Limit)

**User request**:
```
User: "I have an idea for Figma workflow enhancement, but I know
we're working on core enhancements right now."
```

**Claude response**:
```
📊 Checking WIP status...
   Current WIP: 2/2 (at limit)
   Active: 0001-core-framework, 0002-core-enhancements

✅ Good instinct! Since WIP is at limit, let's capture this in backlog.

Creating backlog item: _backlog/0003-figma-workflow-enhancement.md

I'll document:
- Overview (problem statement, solution approach)
- Key components (what needs to be built)
- User value (why this matters)
- Dependencies (what blocks this)
- When to prioritize (conditions for starting)

[Creates file]

✅ Backlog item created!

When ready to start:
1. Close 0001 or 0002 to free WIP slot
2. Run: /inc "Figma workflow enhancement"
3. I'll promote backlog item to full increment
```

#### Example 2: Promote Backlog Item to Increment

**User request**:
```
User: "Increment 0001 is done. Let's work on that Figma enhancement
we discussed."
```

**Claude response**:
```
🔍 Found backlog item: _backlog/0003-figma-workflow-enhancement.md

📊 Checking WIP status...
   Current WIP: 1/2 (slot available!)

✅ Ready to promote! Starting PM-led planning...

Loading backlog item...
→ Reading context from _backlog/0003-figma-workflow-enhancement.md
→ Problem statement ✓
→ Solution approach ✓
→ Key components ✓

Activating PM Agent for complete planning...

PM Agent: Analyzing Figma workflow requirements...
→ Market research complete
→ Creating spec.md (WHAT & WHY)
→ Architect creating plan.md (HOW)
→ Auto-generating tasks.md from plan
→ Creating tests.md (test strategy)

✅ Increment 0003-figma-workflow-enhancement created!

Created:
  ✅ spec.md (12 user stories, 34 requirements)
  ✅ plan.md (5 phases, architecture diagrams)
  ✅ tasks.md (23 tasks, auto-generated)
  ✅ tests.md (test coverage matrix)

Status: planned → Ready to start!

Next: /build to begin implementation
```

#### Example 3: List Backlog Items

**User request**:
```
User: "What ideas do we have in the backlog?"
```

**Claude response**:
```
📋 Backlog Items (.specweave/increments/_backlog/)

1. 0003-figma-workflow-enhancement.md [P2]
   → Complete Figma design-to-code workflow
   → Estimate: 3-4 days
   → Dependencies: None
   → Impact: HIGH

2. 0004-github-sync-improvements.md [P3]
   → Bidirectional GitHub sync with subtasks
   → Estimate: 2 days
   → Dependencies: None
   → Impact: MEDIUM

Total: 2 backlog items

To promote: /inc "feature name"
```

#### Example 4: Quick Add to Backlog (User Prompt)

**User request**:
```
User: "Add 'Advanced analytics dashboard' to backlog for later"
```

**Claude response**:
```
✅ Adding to backlog...

Creating: _backlog/0005-analytics-dashboard.md

Quick template:
- Overview: Advanced analytics dashboard
- Priority: P3 (nice-to-have)
- Estimate: TBD (needs PM analysis)
- Status: backlog
- Created: 2025-10-28

💡 When ready to plan fully, run:
   /inc "Advanced analytics dashboard"

This will promote to full increment with PM-led analysis.
```

### Best Practices

**✅ DO**:
- Add ideas to backlog when WIP limit reached
- Keep backlog items simple (1-page markdown)
- Update priorities as business needs change
- Review backlog regularly (weekly/bi-weekly)
- Promote backlog items with `/inc "name"` for full PM planning

**❌ DON'T**:
- Create full increments while at WIP limit (forces closure)
- Over-plan backlog items (PM does this during promotion)
- Let backlog grow indefinitely (prune stale ideas)
- Skip backlog when WIP available (go direct to `/inc`)

### Backlog Lifecycle

```
Idea captured
    ↓
Saved in _backlog/
    ↓
[Wait for WIP slot]
    ↓
User promotes: /inc "name"
    ↓
PM Agent analyzes
    ↓
Full increment created
    ↓
_backlog/ file archived (kept for history)
```

## WIP Limits

### Purpose

**Prevent context-switching overhead** (20-40% productivity loss), ensure focus, improve quality.

### WIP Limit Guidelines

| Project Type | WIP Limit | Rationale |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Framework development** (SpecWeave repo) | 2-3 in progress | Allows core + 1-2 independent features |
| **User projects** (solo/small team 1-5) | 1-2 in progress | Better focus, higher quality |
| **User projects** (large team 10+) | 3-5 in progress | Multiple sub-teams, still limited |

### Enforcement

- ✅ `/create-increment` checks WIP limit before creating
- ✅ `/start-increment` checks WIP limit before starting
- ✅ Must close increment to free WIP slot

### Override

```bash
/create-increment "..." --force  # Override WIP limit (use sparingly)
```

**When to override** ✅:
- Truly independent work (no dependencies)
- Critical bug fix (production down)
- Blocked on external dependency

**When NOT to override** ❌:
- Impatient to start new work
- Avoiding difficult tasks
- Poor planning

---

## Task vs Increment Decision

### Decision Tree

```
New work request
      ↓
How long will this take?
      ↓
  Hours-Days  →  How many components?
                       ↓
                    1 component  →  TASK (add to current increment)
                    2+ components  →  INCREMENT (if WIP allows)
      ↓
  Weeks+  →  Check WIP limit
                ↓
            WIP < limit  →  NEW INCREMENT
            WIP at limit  →  Close existing or add to backlog
```

### Examples

| Request | Duration | Components | Decision |
|---------|----------|------------|----------|
| "Fix error in context-loader" | 2 hours | 1 skill | **TASK** - Add to current increment |
| "Add caching to context-loader" | 1 day | 1 skill | **TASK** - Add to current increment |
| "Add complete JIRA integration" | 2 weeks | 2 agents + 1 skill | **INCREMENT** - New folder (if WIP allows) |
| "Optimize performance" | 3 days | Multiple files | **TASK** or **INCREMENT** - Depends on scope |

### Rule of Thumb

- **< 1 day + 1 component** = TASK
- **Weeks + multiple components** = INCREMENT

---

## Adding Tasks to Current Increment

### When to Add ✅

- Bugs discovered during implementation
- Small enhancements (< 1 day)
- Error handling improvements
- Documentation updates
- Test additions
- Edge case handling

### How to Add

#### Option 1: Using Slash Command

```bash
/add-tasks 001 "Fix error handling in context-loader"
/add-tasks 001 --priority P2 "Add caching to skill-router"
```

#### Option 2: Manual Addition (tasks.md)

```markdown
## Additional Tasks (Added During Implementation)

### T051: Fix error handling in context-loader
**Added**: 2025-10-26
**Discovered**: During integration testing
**Priority**: P1
**Estimated**: 2 hours
**Status**: [ ] Pending

**Implementation**:
- Check if manifest file exists
- Return helpful error message
- Log warning to logs/errors.log
```

#### Option 3: Update Frontmatter (spec.md)

```yaml
---
updated: 2025-10-26  # ← Update this
total_tasks: 51      # ← Increment
---
```

---

## Closing Increments with Leftover Transfer

### When to Close ✅

- ✅ All P1 (critical) tasks completed
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ❌ P2/P3 tasks MAY remain (can transfer)

### Valid Reasons to Transfer Leftovers

1. **Time-boxed completion** - 2 weeks up, 80% done is enough
2. **Lower priority work remains** - P2/P3 can wait
3. **Scope clarification** - Some tasks no longer relevant
4. **Blocked tasks** - Waiting on external dependencies
5. **Business pivot** - Priorities changed

### Closure Workflow

```bash
/close-increment 001

# System validates:
→ All P1 tasks completed? ✅
→ All tests passing? ✅
→ Documentation updated? ✅

# Identifies leftovers:
→ Leftovers: 6 tasks (3 P2, 3 P3)

# Presents options:
Transfer options:
A) Create new increment "0002-enhancements" with leftovers
B) Add to existing increment (select: 0002, 0003, 0004)
C) Cancel leftovers (document why)

Your choice? [A]

# Generates closure report:
→ Creating .specweave/increments/0001-core-framework/reports/closure-report.md
→ Completion: 88% (44/50 tasks)
→ Transferred to 0002-enhancements: 6 tasks
→ Status: closed
→ WIP slot freed (2/2 → 1/2)

✅ Increment 0001-core-framework closed successfully
```

### Closure Report Format

```markdown
# Increment Closure Report

**Increment**: 0001-core-framework
**Closed Date**: 2025-10-26
**Completion**: 88% (44/50 tasks)

## Transferred Tasks (to 0002-enhancements)

| Task | Description | Priority | Reason |
|------|-------------|----------|--------|
| T045 | Add caching to context-loader | P2 | Performance optimization |
| T046 | Add retry logic to skill-router | P2 | Error handling enhancement |
| T047 | Create skill usage analytics | P3 | Nice-to-have monitoring |

## Retrospective

**What went well**: Clear spec reduced scope creep
**What to improve**: Better task estimation
```

### Task Status Markers

- `[x]` - Completed
- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[-]` - In progress (optional)
- `[T]` - Transferred to another increment
- `[C]` - Canceled (no longer relevant)

### Transferred Task Tracking

**In target increment** (0002-enhancements/tasks.md):

```markdown
## Transferred Tasks (from 0001-core-framework)

### T001: Add caching to context-loader
**Transferred from**: 0001-core-framework (T045)
**Transfer date**: 2025-10-26
**Original priority**: P2
**Current priority**: P1 (promoted - now critical)
```

## Example Workflows

### Example 1: Complete Project Lifecycle

```bash
# Week 1: Create and start core framework
/create-increment "Core Framework"     # Creates 001
/start-increment 001                   # Status: planned → in-progress
# WIP: 1/2

# Week 2-12: Add tasks as discovered
/add-tasks 001 "Fix error in context-loader"
/add-tasks 001 "Add retry logic"

# Week 12: 88% done, ready to move on
/close-increment 001

# System prompts:
→ Completion: 88% (44/50 tasks)
→ Leftovers: 6 P2/P3 tasks
→ Transfer to 0002-enhancements? [Yes]

```

### Example 2: Real Increment with Frontmatter

```yaml
# spec.md frontmatter
---
increment: 0001-user-authentication
title: "User Authentication System"
priority: P1
status: in-progress
created: 2025-01-25
started: 2025-02-01

completed_tasks: 18
completion_rate: 72

dependencies:
  - none

wip_slot: 1
---
```

### Example 3: Token Savings with Context Manifest

**Without manifest**: Load ALL strategy docs (50k tokens)
**With manifest**: Load ONLY auth docs (15k tokens)
**Savings: 70%** ✅

```yaml
# context-manifest.yaml
---
spec_sections:
  - .specweave/docs/internal/strategy/authentication/overview.md
  - .specweave/docs/internal/strategy/authentication/requirements.md

documentation:
