# Product Roadmap

## ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL ROADMAP RULE**

**NEVER plan more than 1 VERSION ahead in public roadmap!**

Why:
- âœ… Prevents over-commitment and disappointment
- âœ… Allows flexibility based on user feedback
- âœ… Focuses team on immediate next milestone
- âœ… Avoids obsolete promises as product evolves

**Rule**: Only show CURRENT version + NEXT version. Everything else is speculation.
