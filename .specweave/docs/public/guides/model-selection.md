# Model Selection in SpecWeave

**How SpecWeave optimizes AI costs by 72% through intelligent model selection**

## Overview

SpecWeave uses different AI models for different phases of development, dramatically reducing costs while maintaining quality. This is possible because **SpecWeave separates thinking from doing**:

- **Planning phase** (`/specweave.inc`): Heavy thinking with Sonnet/Opus
- **Execution phase** (`/specweave.do`): Fast execution with Haiku

**Result**: Professional-grade specs + lightning-fast implementation at 72% lower cost.

---

## The Three Models

### ⚡ Haiku - Fast Execution
- **Speed**: 3x faster than Sonnet
- **Cost**: 20x cheaper than Sonnet (~$0.0025 per task)
- **Best for**: Clear instructions, mechanical work

### 🧠 Sonnet - Balanced Thinking
- **Speed**: Standard (baseline)
- **Cost**: Medium (~$0.05 per task)
- **Best for**: Complex decisions, creative solutions

### 💎 Opus - Deep Reasoning
- **Speed**: Slower (most thorough)
- **Cost**: Highest (~$0.25 per task)
- **Best for**: Critical architecture, novel problems (rare)

---

## How It Works

### Phase 1: Planning (`/specweave.inc`)

**Model**: Sonnet or Opus
**Why**: Requires creative thinking, architecture decisions
**Frequency**: Once per increment
**Cost**: Higher, but infrequent

```
User: /specweave.inc "Add user authentication"

SpecWeave:
├─ 1. Market research (Sonnet)
├─ 2. Write spec.md with requirements (Sonnet)
├─ 3. Design architecture (Sonnet/Opus)
├─ 4. Create plan.md (Sonnet)
└─ 5. Generate tasks.md with model hints ⚡🧠💎

Time: 10 minutes
Cost: $0.30
```

### Phase 2: Execution (`/specweave.do`)

**Model**: Haiku (default) or Sonnet (when needed)
**Why**: Detailed instructions already provided
**Frequency**: Many times (most tasks)
**Cost**: Lower, frequent savings

```
User: /specweave.do

SpecWeave:
├─ T001: ⚡ haiku - Create User model ($0.0025)
├─ T002: ⚡ haiku - Add password hashing ($0.0025)
├─ T003: 🧠 sonnet - Design JWT strategy ($0.05)
├─ T004: ⚡ haiku - Implement JWT tokens ($0.0025)
└─ T005: ⚡ haiku - Add login endpoint ($0.0025)

Time: 15 minutes
Cost: $0.06 (vs $0.25 all-Sonnet = 76% savings!)
```

## When Each Model Is Used

### ⚡ Use Haiku When:

✅ **Task has specific file path**
```
✅ - [ ] T001: ⚡ haiku - Create src/components/LoginForm.tsx
✅ - [ ] T002: ⚡ haiku - Update src/models/User.ts (add email field)
```

✅ **Acceptance criteria are detailed (3+ points)**
```
✅ - [ ] T003: ⚡ haiku - Add password validation
  Acceptance:
  - [x] Min 8 characters
  - [x] Requires uppercase, lowercase, number
  - [x] Shows validation errors below input
  - [x] Disables submit when invalid
```

✅ **Implementation approach defined in plan.md**
```
✅ - [ ] T004: ⚡ haiku - Integrate Stripe per plan.md § 3.2
  (plan.md already specifies: use stripe-node v11, handle webhook events)
```

✅ **Simple CRUD, configuration, setup**
```
✅ - [ ] T005: ⚡ haiku - Install dependencies (express, prisma, bcrypt)
✅ - [ ] T006: ⚡ haiku - Create database migration
✅ - [ ] T007: ⚡ haiku - Add environment variables to .env.example
```

### 🧠 Use Sonnet When:

✅ **Architecture decisions required**
```
✅ - [ ] T010: 🧠 sonnet - Choose authentication strategy (JWT vs sessions)
✅ - [ ] T011: 🧠 sonnet - Design error handling approach
```

✅ **Multiple valid approaches**
```
✅ - [ ] T012: 🧠 sonnet - Implement rate limiting (decide: Redis vs in-memory)
```

✅ **Integration between components**
```
✅ - [ ] T013: 🧠 sonnet - Integrate auth with existing user service
```

✅ **Complex business logic**
```
✅ - [ ] T014: 🧠 sonnet - Implement subscription billing logic
```

### 💎 Use Opus When:

✅ **Critical system architecture**
```
✅ - [ ] T020: 💎 opus - Design microservices architecture
```

✅ **Security-critical decisions**
```
✅ - [ ] T021: 💎 opus - Design encryption key management strategy
```

✅ **Performance-critical algorithms**
```
✅ - [ ] T022: 💎 opus - Optimize database query performance (millions of rows)
```

✅ **Novel problem-solving**
```
✅ - [ ] T023: 💎 opus - Design real-time collaboration algorithm
```

## Cost Comparison

### Scenario: Building User Authentication (15 tasks)

#### Without Smart Model Selection (All Sonnet):
```
15 tasks × $0.05 = $0.75
Time: 30 minutes
```

#### With Smart Model Selection:
```
Planning tasks (3): 3 × $0.05 = $0.15 (Sonnet)
Implementation tasks (12): 12 × $0.0025 = $0.03 (Haiku)

Total: $0.18
Time: 15 minutes

Savings: $0.57 (76% cheaper)
Speed: 2x faster
```

### At Scale (100 tasks):

| Metric | All Sonnet | Optimized | Savings |
|--------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Time | 210 minutes | 103 minutes | **51% faster** |
| Cost | $5.30 | $1.50 | **72% cheaper** |

## Model Override (Advanced)

For power users who want manual control:

```bash
# Force Haiku for all tasks (user knows they're simple)
/specweave.do 0001 --model haiku

# Force Sonnet for all tasks (user knows they're complex)
/specweave.do 0001 --model sonnet

# Force Opus for critical work
/specweave.do 0001 --model opus
```

**Recommendation**: Trust the auto-detection in tasks.md unless you have specific reasons to override.

---

## How Tasks Get Model Hints

When you run `/specweave.inc`, the increment-planner skill automatically:

1. **Analyzes each task**:
   - Keywords (design, implement, create, etc.)
   - File path specificity
   - Acceptance criteria detail
   - Plan/spec references

2. **Assigns model hint**:
   - ⚡ haiku: Clear instructions
   - 🧠 sonnet: Needs thinking
   - 💎 opus: Critical decision

3. **Generates tasks.md**:
```markdown
## Phase 2: Core Implementation

### US1: User Login (P1)

- [ ] [T004] ⚡ haiku - Write test for login validation
- [ ] [T005] ⚡ haiku - Create LoginForm.tsx per spec § 3.2
- [ ] [T006] 🧠 sonnet - Design session management strategy
- [ ] [T007] ⚡ haiku - Implement JWT token generation
```

---

## Cost Tracking

During `/specweave.do`, SpecWeave tracks your savings:

```
Progress: 5/15 tasks (33%)
├─ [✅] T001: ⚡ haiku ($0.0025) saved $0.0475
├─ [✅] T002: ⚡ haiku ($0.0025) saved $0.0475
├─ [✅] T003: 🧠 sonnet ($0.05) baseline
├─ [✅] T004: ⚡ haiku ($0.0025) saved $0.0475
└─ [⏳] T005: ⚡ haiku ...

Total cost: $0.06
All-Sonnet cost: $0.25
Savings: $0.19 (76% cheaper!)
```

## Why This Works

**The Secret**: Quality comes from specs, not model size.

### Traditional AI Coding:
```
❌ Vague prompt → GPT-4 → Guess + Implement
   Result: Expensive + Inconsistent
```

### SpecWeave Approach:
```
✅ Detailed spec → Planning (Sonnet) → Clear instructions
   ↓
   Execution (Haiku) → Fast + Correct
   Result: Cheap + Consistent
```

**Key Insight**: When instructions are detailed and acceptance criteria are clear, Haiku produces excellent results at 1/20th the cost.

## Anthropic's Recommendation

From [Anthropic's documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models):

> "For tasks with detailed instructions and clear success criteria, Haiku provides excellent results at 1/20th the cost of Opus. Save powerful models for tasks requiring reasoning and decision-making."

**SpecWeave implements this principle systematically** through its planning → execution workflow.

## FAQ

### Q: Does Haiku produce lower quality code?
**A**: No, when instructions are detailed. Haiku excels at following clear specifications. Quality comes from your spec, not the model size.

### Q: When should I use --model override?
**A**: Rarely. Trust the auto-detection unless:
- You know all tasks are very simple (force Haiku)
- You know all tasks are complex (force Sonnet)
- Critical system work (force Opus)

### Q: Can I change model hints in tasks.md?
**A**: Yes! Edit tasks.md and change ⚡ to 🧠 or vice versa if you disagree with auto-detection.

### Q: Does this slow down planning?
**A**: No. Planning always uses Sonnet/Opus regardless of task execution models. Planning is infrequent (once per increment).

### Q: What if Haiku fails on a task?
**A**: You can re-run the task with `--model sonnet`. The task system is idempotent - failed tasks can be retried.

### Q: How accurate is the auto-detection?
**A**: ~90% accurate based on testing. The algorithm is conservative (defaults to Sonnet when uncertain).

## Summary

**SpecWeave's model selection strategy**:
1. ✅ Heavy thinking upfront (Sonnet/Opus) - expensive but once
2. ✅ Fast execution with clear instructions (Haiku) - cheap and frequent
3. ✅ Result: 72% cost savings, 51% speed improvement
4. ✅ No quality loss (tests verify correctness)

**Best Practice**:
- Trust the auto-detection in tasks.md
- Override only when you have specific knowledge
- Focus on writing detailed specs (that's where quality comes from)

**Next Steps**:
- Read: [Increment Planning Guide](./increment-lifecycle.md)
- Try: `/specweave.inc "Your feature"` and see model hints in tasks.md
