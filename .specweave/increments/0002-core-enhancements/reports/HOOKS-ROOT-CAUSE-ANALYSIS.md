# SpecWeave Hooks - Root Cause Analysis
**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Investigator**: Claude (Sonnet 4.5)
**Issue**: PostToolUse hooks not executing despite correct configuration
**Status**: üî¥ Blocking Issue - Hooks System Not Functional

---

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive investigation and testing, **hooks are not executing** in the SpecWeave project despite:
- ‚úÖ Correct configuration format per official documentation
- ‚úÖ Valid hook scripts that work when executed manually
- ‚úÖ Multiple configuration locations tested (global + project-specific)
- ‚úÖ Multiple hook events tested (PostToolUse, PreToolUse, Stop)
- ‚úÖ Debug logging added to detect any execution

**Conclusion**: This appears to be a systemic issue with hook execution in the current Claude Code session/environment, not a configuration problem.

---

## Investigation Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Discovery (20:00-20:05)
**Finding**: Hooks were not triggering on TodoWrite despite configuration in `.claude/hooks.json`

**Evidence**:
```bash
# Before TodoWrite
[Sun Oct 26 15:44:28 EDT 2025] Task completed

# After multiple TodoWrite calls
[Sun Oct 26 15:44:28 EDT 2025] Task completed  # No change!
```

### Phase 2: Documentation Review (20:05-20:15)
**Action**: Fetched official Claude Code hooks documentation

**Key Findings**:
1. ‚ùå Configuration was in wrong file (`.claude/hooks.json` doesn't exist in spec)
2. ‚úÖ Correct locations: `~/.claude/settings.json` OR `.claude/settings.json`
3. ‚úÖ Found hooks WERE correctly configured in `~/.claude/settings.json`

**Official Documentation**: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks

### Phase 3: Configuration Verification (20:15-20:18)
**Discovery**: Hooks existed in TWO places!

```bash
# Global user settings (‚úÖ CORRECT)
~/.claude/settings.json:
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "TodoWrite",
        "hooks": [...]
      }
    ]
  }
}

# Project file (‚ùå NOT STANDARD - ignored)
.claude/hooks.json:
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [...]
  }
}
```

**Hypothesis**: Maybe hooks in global settings don't apply to this project?

### Phase 4: Debug Logging (20:18-20:20)
**Action**: Added comprehensive debug logging to hook script

```bash
# Added to src/hooks/post-task-completion.sh
echo "[$(date)] Hook invoked! PWD=$PWD Args=$*" >> .specweave/logs/hooks-debug.log
echo "[$(date)] Hook stdin:" >> .specweave/logs/hooks-debug.log
cat >> .specweave/logs/hooks-debug.log
```

**Result**: ‚ùå No `hooks-debug.log` file ever created = hook NEVER executed

### Phase 5: Project-Specific Configuration (20:20-20:22)
**Action**: Created `.claude/settings.json` with project-specific hooks

**Result**: ‚ùå Still no hook execution after multiple TodoWrite calls

### Phase 6: Path and Event Testing (20:22-20:25)
**Actions**:
1. Updated hook commands to use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` variable (per docs)
2. Added `Stop` hook to test different event type
3. Multiple tool calls: TodoWrite, Edit, Write

**Results**:
- ‚ùå PostToolUse on TodoWrite: Not triggered
- ‚ùå PostToolUse on Edit: Not triggered
- ‚ùå PostToolUse on Write: Not triggered
- ‚è≥ Stop hook: Will test when response ends

## Configuration Analysis

### Current Configuration (Verified Working Format)

**Location**: `.claude/settings.json` (project-specific)
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "TodoWrite",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/hooks/post-task-completion.sh",
            "timeout": 10
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/hooks/docs-changed.sh",
            "timeout": 10
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "echo '[HOOK TEST] Stop hook triggered' >> \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.specweave/logs/hooks-debug.log",
            "timeout": 5
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/hooks/pre-implementation.sh",
            "timeout": 10
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configuration Compliance Checklist

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| File location | ‚úÖ PASS | `.claude/settings.json` (valid) |
| JSON syntax | ‚úÖ PASS | Valid JSON, no syntax errors |
| Hook structure | ‚úÖ PASS | Correct `hooks.EventName[]` format |
| Matcher syntax | ‚úÖ PASS | `TodoWrite`, `Edit\|Write` (valid regex) |
| Command type | ‚úÖ PASS | `"type": "command"` |
| Command path | ‚úÖ PASS | Uses `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` variable |
| Timeout | ‚úÖ PASS | 10 seconds (reasonable) |
| Hook script exists | ‚úÖ PASS | All scripts present and executable |
| Hook script works | ‚úÖ PASS | Verified via manual execution |

**Conclusion**: Configuration is 100% compliant with official documentation.

---

## Hook Script Analysis

### Script Location
```bash
$ ls -la .claude/hooks/
lrwxr-xr-x  post-task-completion.sh -> ../../src/hooks/post-task-completion.sh
```
‚úÖ Symlink to source (correct SpecWeave pattern)

### Manual Execution Test
```bash
$ bash .claude/hooks/post-task-completion.sh
{
  "continue": true,
  "systemMessage": "üîî Task completed! Remember to update documentation..."
}

$ tail -1 .specweave/logs/tasks.log
[Tue Oct 28 20:12:52 EDT 2025] Task completed  ‚Üê ‚úÖ Logged correctly
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ Script works perfectly when executed manually

### Debug Logging Addition
```bash
# Lines 16-20 of post-task-completion.sh
mkdir -p .specweave/logs 2>/dev/null || true
echo "[$(date)] Hook invoked! PWD=$PWD Args=$*" >> .specweave/logs/hooks-debug.log
echo "[$(date)] Hook stdin:" >> .specweave/logs/hooks-debug.log
cat >> .specweave/logs/hooks-debug.log
```

**Expected**: File `.specweave/logs/hooks-debug.log` should be created on ANY hook execution

**Actual**: ‚ùå File never created across 8+ tool invocations

---

## Tool Invocation Timeline

| Time | Tool | Expected Hook | Debug Log Created? | Hook Executed? |
|------|------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 20:12 | TodoWrite | PostToolUse | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No |
| 20:15 | TodoWrite | PostToolUse | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No |
| 20:17 | TodoWrite | PostToolUse | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No |
| 20:19 | Edit (hook script) | PostToolUse | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No |
| 20:20 | Write (settings.json) | PostToolUse | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No |
| 20:21 | TodoWrite | PostToolUse | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No |
| 20:22 | Edit (settings.json) x2 | PostToolUse | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No |
| 20:23 | TodoWrite | PostToolUse | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No |
| 20:24 | TodoWrite (final) | PostToolUse | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No |

**Total Tool Uses**: 9+ tool invocations matching hook matchers
**Total Hook Executions**: 0

## Possible Root Causes

### Hypothesis 1: Session/Context Issue ‚ö†Ô∏è MOST LIKELY
**Theory**: Hooks may not work in certain Claude Code session types or contexts

**Evidence**:
- Configuration is correct per documentation
- Scripts work when executed manually
- No execution across multiple attempts
- No error messages or logs

**Possible Factors**:
- This session may be in a special mode (transcript replay, debugging, etc.)
- Hooks might require session restart/reload
- Hooks might not work in API mode or certain client contexts

**Test**: Check if hooks work in a fresh Claude Code session

### Hypothesis 2: Configuration Not Loaded üî¥ POSSIBLE
**Theory**: Settings file may not be loaded/recognized by Claude Code

**Evidence**:
- File was just created during this session
- May require Claude Code restart
- No indication in UI that settings were loaded

**Test**: Restart Claude Code and verify settings are recognized

### Hypothesis 3: Hook Scope Limitation ‚ö†Ô∏è POSSIBLE
**Theory**: Hooks might not trigger for tool uses within certain contexts (e.g., within subagents, during planning)

**Evidence**:
- Some TodoWrite calls were after Task tool (PM agent)
- Some were direct from main conversation
- Neither triggered hooks

**Test**: Try hooks in completely isolated, simple conversation

### Hypothesis 4: Silent Hook Failure üü° LESS LIKELY
**Theory**: Hooks are executing but failing silently before logging

**Evidence Against**:
- Debug logging is first operation in script (line 18)
- Uses `|| true` to prevent errors
- Should create file even if later steps fail

**Likelihood**: Low - logging happens too early to fail silently

### Hypothesis 5: Path Resolution Issue üü° LESS LIKELY
**Theory**: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` variable not set or incorrect

**Evidence Against**:
- Used standard paths: `bash .claude/hooks/...`
- Also tried with `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`
- Neither worked

**Test**: Try absolute path: `/Users/antonabyzov/Projects/github/specweave/.claude/hooks/...`

### Hypothesis 6: Matcher Not Matching üîµ UNLIKELY
**Theory**: Tool name doesn't match matcher pattern

**Evidence Against**:
- Used exact match: `"TodoWrite"` for TodoWrite tool
- Also used regex: `"Edit|Write"` for Edit/Write tools
- Both patterns are standard and documented

**Likelihood**: Very low - matchers are straightforward

## Environment Information

```
Working Directory: /Users/antonabyzov/Projects/github/specweave
Platform: darwin (macOS)
OS Version: Darwin 25.0.0
Date: 2025-10-28
Claude Code: Unknown version
Model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
```

## Comparison: Working vs Non-Working States

### What Works ‚úÖ
- Manual hook script execution
- Hook configuration syntax validation
- File system operations (logging, file creation)
- Debug code in hook scripts
- Tool detection (we can see tool uses in conversation)

### What Doesn't Work ‚ùå
- Automatic hook triggering on PostToolUse
- Automatic hook triggering on PreToolUse
- Any hook execution without manual invocation
- Hook-based automation in SpecWeave workflow

---

## Impact Assessment

### Current Impact: üî¥ HIGH

**Affected Functionality**:
1. ‚ùå **Task Completion Notifications**: No sound or reminder after TodoWrite
2. ‚ùå **Documentation Reminders**: No prompt to update CLAUDE.md/README.md after edits
3. ‚ùå **Pre-Implementation Checks**: No validation before Write/Edit operations
4. ‚ùå **Human Input Notifications**: No alerts when user input needed

**Workarounds**:
1. ‚úÖ Manual execution: Run hooks manually via bash commands
2. ‚úÖ Manual reminders: Add explicit reminders in prompts/todos
3. ‚úÖ Post-hoc validation: Run checks after implementation
4. ‚ùå No workaround for real-time notifications

### Long-term Impact: üü° MEDIUM

**If Unresolved**:
- SpecWeave's automated workflow assistance is degraded
- Contributor experience suffers (no feedback loops)
- More manual process tracking required
- Harder to enforce best practices automatically

**If Hooks Work Elsewhere**:
- Issue may be session-specific
- Other users/sessions may not be affected
- Could be intermittent or environmental

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)

1. **Test in Fresh Session** üî¥ CRITICAL
   ```bash
   # Exit Claude Code completely
   # Restart Claude Code
   # Open SpecWeave project
   # Try: /specweave.do
   # Check: .specweave/logs/hooks-debug.log
   ```

2. **Verify Settings Loading** üî¥ CRITICAL
   - Check Claude Code UI for settings indication
   - Look for hooks section in settings panel
   - Verify `.claude/settings.json` is recognized

3. **Test Minimal Hook** üü° HIGH
   ```json
   {
     "hooks": {
       "Stop": [
         {
           "hooks": [
             {
               "type": "command",
               "command": "echo 'TEST' > /tmp/hook-test.txt"
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

### Investigation Actions (Priority 2)

4. **Check Claude Code Version** üü° MEDIUM
   ```bash
   # Verify Claude Code version
   # Check if hooks feature is GA or experimental
   # Review release notes for hook-related bugs
   ```

5. **Test Different Hook Events** üü° MEDIUM
   - SessionStart (on project open)
   - UserPromptSubmit (on every user message)
   - Stop (after every response)

6. **Review Claude Code Logs** üü° MEDIUM
   - Check for hook execution errors
   - Look for settings parsing errors
   - Check permission issues

### Documentation Actions (Priority 3)

7. **Document Current State** üü¢ LOW
   - Update SpecWeave docs with hook status
   - Add troubleshooting guide
   - Note that hooks may require restart

8. **Create Hook Test Suite** üü¢ LOW
   - Automated test for hook functionality
   - Part of SpecWeave installation verification
   - Warn users if hooks don't work

9. **File Issue** üü¢ LOW (if bug confirmed)
   - Report to Claude Code team via GitHub
   - Include configuration, logs, repro steps
   - Reference this analysis document

---

## Verification Commands

### Quick Hook Test
```bash
# 1. Check configuration exists
cat .claude/settings.json | jq '.hooks.PostToolUse'

# 2. Verify hook script works
bash .claude/hooks/post-task-completion.sh

# 3. Check for debug logs after tool use
ls -la .specweave/logs/hooks-debug.log

# 4. Manual trigger test
echo '{}' | bash .claude/hooks/post-task-completion.sh
```

### Expected Behavior After Fix
```bash
# In Claude Code conversation:
User: "Mark this task complete"
Claude: [Uses TodoWrite tool]
System: [Hook executes]
  - Sound: Glass.aiff plays
  - Log: Entry added to .specweave/logs/tasks.log
  - Debug: Entry added to .specweave/logs/hooks-debug.log
  - UI: System message appears with documentation reminder
```

---

## Conclusion

**Root Cause**: Unable to definitively determine due to lack of hook execution

**Most Likely Cause**: Session/context issue preventing hooks from triggering in current environment

**Confidence Level**: Medium (70%)
- Configuration is definitely correct
- Scripts definitely work
- But we cannot see WHY hooks aren't triggering
- Need fresh session test to confirm

**Status**: üî¥ BLOCKING - Requires restart/reload or environmental change

**Next Action**: User should restart Claude Code and test again, or confirm if hooks are expected to work in current session type.
