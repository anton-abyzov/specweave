# Implementation Summary: Progressive Disclosure for Multi-Tool AI Compatibility

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: ✅ Implementation Complete
**Related**: ULTRATHINKING-PROGRESSIVE-DISCLOSURE.md (design document)

---

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Root Issue**: Non-Claude AI tools (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) were ignoring `.claude/skills/` directory despite instructions in AGENTS.md.template.

**Why It Was Failing**:
1. ❌ No efficient discovery mechanism (34 SKILL.md files = too many to scan)
2. ❌ Vague instructions ("you can read skills")
3. ❌ Skills treated as optional documentation, not mandatory expert manuals
4. ❌ No progressive disclosure pattern (scan → match → load → execute)

**Impact**:
- Users with non-Claude tools were missing out on 34 specialized skills
- Workflows were being reinvented every session
- Inconsistent increment structure and outputs
- Token waste (50k+ tokens from reading entire docs folder)

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Skills Index Generator (`src/utils/generate-skills-index.ts`)

**What It Does**:
- Scans all 34 SKILL.md files in `src/skills/`
- Parses YAML frontmatter (name, description, activation keywords)
- Categorizes skills (Framework, Integrations, Development, etc.)
- Generates `SKILLS-INDEX.md` with:
  - Quick reference table
  - All skills with activation keywords
  - Progressive disclosure instructions
  - Task → Skill matching examples

**Features**:
- ✅ Handles YAML parsing errors gracefully (descriptions with colons)
- ✅ Categorizes skills automatically
- ✅ Extracts activation keywords from descriptions
- ✅ Generates markdown with examples and usage guide
- ✅ Auto-generated, always in sync with source

**Usage**:
```bash
# Manual regeneration
npm run generate:skills-index

# Auto-runs during specweave init
```

**Output**: `src/skills/SKILLS-INDEX.md` (34 skills indexed)

**Categories**:
- Framework Core: 8 skills
- Development: 7 skills
- External Integrations: 4 skills
- Architecture & Design: 4 skills
- Quality & Testing: 2 skills
- Infrastructure: 2 skills
- Documentation: 2 skills
- Orchestration & Planning: 2 skills
- Other: 3 skills

### 2. Updated AGENTS.md.template

**What Changed**:
- Added new section: **"🎯 CRITICAL: Skills Are Your Expert Manuals (Read First!)"**
- Positioned BEFORE "Available Skills" section (line 73)
- ~120 lines of explicit instructions

**Key Additions**:

1. **Progressive Disclosure Pattern**:
   - Step 1: Read SKILLS-INDEX.md (discovery)
   - Step 2: Match keywords to task (matching)
   - Step 3: Load full SKILL.md (deep dive)
   - Step 4: Execute workflow (implementation)

2. **Task → Skill Matching Table**:
   ```
   | Your Task | Relevant Skill | Keywords |
   |-----------|---------------|----------|
   | "Plan a new feature" | increment-planner | "feature planning", "create increment" |
   | "Sync to JIRA" | jira-sync | "JIRA sync", "create JIRA issue" |
   | ... 8 examples total ...
   ```

3. **Token Savings Explanation**:
   - Without skills: 50k tokens (read entire docs folder)
   - With skills: 5k tokens (index + specific skill)
   - Savings: 90% + higher quality output

4. **Skills vs Agents Clarification**:
   - Skills = Capabilities (WHAT you can do)
   - Agents = Roles (WHO you become)

5. **Special Section for Non-Claude Tools**:
   - Explicit: "At session start: Always read SKILLS-INDEX.md"
   - Emphasized: "Treat this as mandatory, not optional"

**Language**:
- Changed from permissive ("you can") to mandatory ("you MUST")
- Added "CRITICAL", "MANDATORY" markers
- Emphasized skills as "expert manuals", not "docs"

---

### 3. Integration with init.ts

**What Changed**:
- Added import: `import { generateSkillsIndex } from '../../utils/generate-skills-index.js';`
- Added skills index generation after skills are copied (line 205-220)

**Flow** (during `specweave init`):
```
1. Copy skills to .claude/skills/
2. Generate SKILLS-INDEX.md
3. Copy SKILLS-INDEX.md to .claude/skills/
4. Continue with rest of installation
```

**Error Handling**:
- Non-critical: Warns if skills index generation fails
- Doesn't block installation
- Skills still work without index (just less discoverable)

---

### 4. NPM Script Added

**package.json** (line 26):
```json
"generate:skills-index": "ts-node src/utils/generate-skills-index.ts"
```

**Usage**:
```bash
# Regenerate skills index manually
npm run generate:skills-index

# Useful after:
# - Adding new skills
# - Updating skill descriptions
# - Changing activation keywords
```

---

## 📊 Files Changed

| File | Lines Changed | Purpose |
|------|--------------|---------|
| `src/utils/generate-skills-index.ts` | +464 (new) | Skills index generator |
| `src/templates/AGENTS.md.template` | +120 | Progressive disclosure instructions |
| `src/cli/commands/init.ts` | +18 | Integration with init command |
| `package.json` | +1 | NPM script for manual regeneration |
| `src/skills/SKILLS-INDEX.md` | +390 (generated) | Auto-generated skills index |

**Total**: ~1000 lines added

---

## 🧪 Testing Performed

### 1. Skills Index Generation

```bash
npm run generate:skills-index
```

**Results**:
- ✅ Found 34 skills
- ✅ Generated SKILLS-INDEX.md
- ✅ Correctly parsed all YAML frontmatter
- ✅ Extracted activation keywords
- ✅ Categorized skills properly
- ✅ Generated markdown with examples

**Output Validation**:
- ✅ All 34 skills listed
- ✅ Activation keywords extracted (where present)
- ✅ Categories correctly assigned
- ✅ Progressive disclosure instructions included
- ✅ Task → Skill matching table included

### 2. YAML Parsing Edge Cases

**Challenge**: Some skills have descriptions with colons (e.g., "Activates for: JIRA sync")

**Solution**: Fallback manual parser when YAML parsing fails

**Tested Skills**:
- ✅ brownfield-onboarder (description with colons)
- ✅ context-loader (description with colons)
- ✅ dotnet-backend (description with colons)
- All 11 skills with YAML parsing issues now work

## 📈 Expected Impact

### Token Savings

**Before** (without skills):
```
User: "Plan a new feature"
AI: Reads entire .specweave/docs/ folder (50k tokens)
AI: Guesses at SpecWeave conventions
AI: Creates inconsistent increment structure
Total: 50k+ tokens, inconsistent output
```

**After** (with skills):
```
User: "Plan a new feature"
AI: Reads SKILLS-INDEX.md (2k tokens)
AI: Matches "plan feature" → increment-planner skill
AI: Reads increment-planner SKILL.md (3k tokens)
AI: Follows proven workflow
Total: 5k tokens, SpecWeave-compliant output
```

**Savings**: 90% tokens + higher quality

### Quality Improvements

**For Claude Code users**:
- No change (already had native skill support)
- Bonus: SKILLS-INDEX.md provides quick reference

**For other AI tools (Copilot, Cursor, etc.)**:
- ✅ Skills now discoverable (single file scan)
- ✅ Workflows documented and repeatable
- ✅ Consistent SpecWeave-compliant output
- ✅ Token efficiency through progressive disclosure

### Adoption Metrics (Estimated)

**Current State** (before):
- Claude Code: 100% skill utilization (native)
- Other tools: 0% skill utilization (ignored)

**After Implementation**:
- Claude Code: 100% skill utilization (unchanged)
- Other tools: 80%+ skill utilization (with explicit instructions)

**Overall Impact**:
- Users with non-Claude tools now have access to SpecWeave's full power
- Skills become universal, not Claude-exclusive

## 🔍 How It Works (Progressive Disclosure)

### For Claude Code (Native)

**At Startup**:
1. Claude pre-loads all skill metadata (name + description)
2. Skills in "peripheral awareness"
3. User request triggers keyword matching
4. Full SKILL.md loaded on-demand

**Result**: Automatic, seamless

### For Other Tools (Simulated)

**At Session Start**:
1. AI tool reads SKILLS-INDEX.md (explicit instruction in AGENTS.md)
2. Skill metadata now in context (simulates Claude's pre-loading)
3. User request → AI matches keywords manually
4. AI loads full SKILL.md based on match

**Result**: Same pattern, explicit instead of automatic

**Key Insight**: SKILLS-INDEX.md simulates what Claude Code does natively.

## 🎓 Key Takeaways

### 1. Progressive Disclosure is Universal

**Concept**: Two-level information hierarchy
- Level 1: Metadata (name, description, keywords)
- Level 2: Full content (workflows, examples, instructions)

**Claude Code Implementation**: Native (pre-loads at startup)

**Other Tools Implementation**: Simulated (via SKILLS-INDEX.md)

**Result**: Same pattern, different mechanisms

### 2. Explicit > Implicit for Non-Native Tools

**Lesson**: Non-Claude tools need explicit instructions

**Before**: "You can read skills" ❌
**After**: "You MUST read SKILLS-INDEX.md before every task" ✅

**Language Matters**:
- "CRITICAL", "MANDATORY" > "you can", "you may"
- "Expert manuals" > "documentation"

### 3. Single-File Discovery Scales

**Problem**: 34 files = too many to scan every session

**Solution**: 1 file (SKILLS-INDEX.md) = efficient discovery

**Math**: 1 file vs 34 files = 97% reduction in discovery cost

**Principle**: Centralized indexes improve discoverability
