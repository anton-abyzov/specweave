# Post-Release Documentation Update - v0.3.7

**Date**: 2025-10-29
**Action**: Documentation corrections after v0.3.7 release
**Triggered By**: User feedback on misleading documentation

---

## Issues Identified

### 1. ‚ùå Bug Analysis Documentation Was Wrong

**File**: `BUG-ANALYSIS-WINDOWS-EMPTY-CLAUDE-DIRS.md`

**Problem**: Document said "Solution 1: Add --adapter Flag (Best for User Control) ‚≠ê"

**Reality**:
- We did NOT implement "Solution 1"
- The `--adapter` flag **already existed** in the code
- We implemented a **simpler solution**: just changed the default from `'generic'` to `'claude'`

**Fix**: Updated document to show what was ACTUALLY implemented:
```markdown
### ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED: Default to Claude (Simplest and Best) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**What We Actually Did**: Changed `detectTool()` to default to `'claude'` instead of `'generic'`
```

---

### 2. ‚ùå Missing Hook Notifications

**Problem**: User noticed no "Task completed!" message during v0.3.7 publishing

**Root Cause**: I didn't call `TodoWrite` during the publishing process

**Why**: I was focused on executing bash commands and forgot to track progress

**Hook Status**: ‚úÖ Hook is still there and working correctly (`.claude/hooks/post-task-completion.sh`)

**Lesson**: Always use `TodoWrite` to track multi-step processes, even for publishing

---

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Misleading Terminology

**Problem**: Docs referred to "claude adapter" which is confusing

**Reality**:
- **Claude Code** = DEFAULT (native, best experience)
- **Claude is NOT an adapter** - it's the baseline
- **Adapters** = for OTHER tools (Cursor, Copilot, generic)

**Fix**: Updated all documentation to clarify:
- "Claude Code (default)" instead of "Claude adapter"
- "Claude Code (best experience, native support)"
- "Other tools use adapters"

---

## Documentation Updates Made

### 1. ‚úÖ README.md

**Changes**:
- Updated version badge: `0.2.0` ‚Üí `0.3.7`
- Changed "Works with Claude (native)" ‚Üí "Works with Claude Code (default)"
- Clarified `.claude/` is for Claude Code (default, best experience)

**File**: `/Users/antonabyzov/Projects/github/specweave/README.md`

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Docusaurus Intro (docs-site/docs/intro.md)

**Changes**:
- Updated installation command: `specweave init` ‚Üí `specweave init .`
- Added note: "SpecWeave automatically detects and configures for **Claude Code** (default)"
- Clarified `.claude/` directory is Claude Code only
- Added: "Intent-Based Commands" feature (competitive advantage vs Kiro)

**Key Addition**:
```markdown
**Note**: SpecWeave automatically detects and configures for **Claude Code** (default),
providing the best experience with native skills, agents, and slash commands.
For other tools (Cursor, Copilot, etc.), use `specweave init . --adapter <tool>`.
```

**File**: `/Users/antonabyzov/Projects/github/specweave/docs-site/docs/intro.md`

---

### 3. ‚úÖ CLAUDE.md (Contributor Guide)

**Changes**:
- Updated version: `0.2.0` ‚Üí `0.3.7`
- Updated description: "Windows fix + Competitive advantages documented"
- Updated current work status: "73% complete" ‚Üí "complete - testing phase"
- Added latest release notes: "v0.3.7 - Fixed Windows installation"
- Added roadmap: "v0.4.0 - Hook debouncing, improved detection"

**File**: `/Users/antonabyzov/Projects/github/specweave/CLAUDE.md`

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Bug Analysis Report

**Changes**:
- Moved "Solution 1" to show it already existed
- Added new section: "‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED: Default to Claude"
- Clarified what was ACTUALLY shipped in v0.3.7
- Emphasized simplicity of the fix (1 line change)

**File**: `.specweave/increments/0002-core-enhancements/reports/BUG-ANALYSIS-WINDOWS-EMPTY-CLAUDE-DIRS.md`

---

## Why These Updates Matter

### 1. **Accuracy** ‚úÖ
Documentation now reflects what was ACTUALLY implemented, not what was proposed.

### 2. **Clarity** ‚úÖ
Users understand that:
- Claude Code is the DEFAULT (not an "adapter")
- The fix was simple (just changed default)
- `--adapter` flag already existed

### 3. **User Experience** ‚úÖ
Clear instructions:
- `specweave init .` ‚Üí works out of the box (defaults to claude)
- `specweave init . --adapter cursor` ‚Üí for Cursor users
- No confusion about "adapters" vs "default"

### 4. **Competitive Positioning** ‚úÖ
Added mention of intent-based commands (SpecWeave advantage over Kiro):
> **üöÄ Intent-Based Commands** - Natural language works too! Say "create auth feature" ‚Üí auto-invokes `/pi "auth"`

## Hook Analysis

### Why No "Task Completed!" During Publishing?

**Root Cause**: I did not call `TodoWrite` during the publishing process.

**What Happened**:
1. User asked to publish v0.3.7
2. I ran bash commands directly (git, npm publish, git tag)
3. **I never called TodoWrite** ‚Üí Hook never fired
4. User noticed absence of "Task completed!" message

**What Should Have Happened**:
```typescript
// Start
TodoWrite([
  {content: "Commit changes", status: "in_progress"},
  {content: "Publish to NPM", status: "pending"},
  {content: "Create git tag", status: "pending"}
]);

// After commit
TodoWrite([
  {content: "Commit changes", status: "completed"},  // ‚Üê Hook fires here
  {content: "Publish to NPM", status: "in_progress"},
  {content: "Create git tag", status: "pending"}
]);

// After publish
TodoWrite([
  {content: "Commit changes", status: "completed"},
  {content: "Publish to NPM", status: "completed"},  // ‚Üê Hook fires here
  {content: "Create git tag", status: "in_progress"}
]);

// After tag
TodoWrite([
  {content: "Commit changes", status: "completed"},
  {content: "Publish to NPM", status: "completed"},
  {content: "Create git tag", status: "completed"}  // ‚Üê Hook fires here
]);
```

**Result**: Hook would fire 3 times (once per completion)

**Better Approach** (to avoid duplicates):
```typescript
// Do all work
commitChanges();
publishToNPM();
createGitTag();

// Update ONCE at the end
TodoWrite([
  {content: "Commit changes", status: "completed"},
  {content: "Publish to NPM", status: "completed"},
  {content: "Create git tag", status: "completed"}
]);
// ‚Üê Hook fires ONCE
```

**Hook Status**: ‚úÖ Working correctly - just wasn't invoked

**Fix for Future**: I'll use TodoWrite for multi-step processes like publishing

---

## Previous Duplicate Hook Issue

### What Caused Duplicates Before?

**Root Cause**: I was calling `TodoWrite` multiple times with completed tasks

**Example**:
```typescript
// Call 1
TodoWrite([{content: "Task A", status: "completed"}]);
// ‚Üí Hook fires (1)

// Call 2
TodoWrite([
  {content: "Task A", status: "completed"},
  {content: "Task B", status: "completed"}
]);
// ‚Üí Hook fires (2) ‚Üê DUPLICATE!
```

**Solution**: Batch updates into single call

---

## Testing Confirmation

### ‚úÖ Windows Testing (User Reported)

**Command**: `specweave init .`

**Result**:
```
‚úÖ Detected: claude (native - full automation)
‚úì Copied 13 command files
‚úì Copied 10 agent directories
‚úì Copied 36 skill directories
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIX CONFIRMED WORKING ON WINDOWS!**

This was the primary goal of v0.3.7, and it's now verified working.

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Always Update Docs Immediately ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Problem**: Bug analysis document said "Solution 1" was implemented, but it wasn't.

**Lesson**: Update documentation DURING implementation, not after.

### 2. Use TodoWrite for All Multi-Step Processes ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Problem**: Publishing didn't trigger hook because I skipped TodoWrite.

**Lesson**: Even for "simple" multi-step processes, use TodoWrite for:
- Progress tracking
- Hook notifications
- Audit trail

### 3. Batch TodoWrite Updates to Avoid Duplicates ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Problem**: Multiple TodoWrite calls with completed tasks ‚Üí duplicate hook fires

**Lesson**: Complete all work first, then update todos in a single call.

### 4. Terminology Matters ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Problem**: "Claude adapter" is confusing (Claude is NOT an adapter).

**Lesson**: Be precise with terminology:
- Claude Code = default (native)
- Adapters = for other tools

---

## Conclusion

‚úÖ **Documentation is now accurate and up-to-date**

**What Changed**:
- Version badges updated (0.3.7)
- Terminology clarified (Claude Code = default, not adapter)
- Bug analysis corrected (shows what was ACTUALLY implemented)
- Installation notes improved (automatic detection explained)
- Competitive advantages added (intent-based commands)

**Hook Issue Resolved**:
