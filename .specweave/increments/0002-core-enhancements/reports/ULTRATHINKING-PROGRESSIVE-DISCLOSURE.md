# Ultrathinking Analysis: Progressive Disclosure for Multi-Tool AI Compatibility

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Context**: Skills not being discovered/used by non-Claude AI tools
**Problem**: GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and other tools ignore `.claude/skills/` despite instructions in AGENTS.md
**Root Cause**: Missing progressive disclosure pattern that Claude Code uses natively

---

## üéØ The Core Problem

### What's Happening

1. **Claude Code** (native): ‚úÖ Works perfectly
   - Reads YAML frontmatter from all SKILL.md files at startup
   - Holds skill names/descriptions in memory (first level of disclosure)
   - Loads full SKILL.md when keywords match user request (second level)
   - Automatic, built into the tool

2. **Other AI Tools** (Copilot, Cursor, etc.): ‚ùå Completely ignore skills
   - No native skill support
   - Rely on AGENTS.md.template instructions
   - Current instructions too vague: "Read the skill file: .claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md"
   - No workflow for discovery ‚Üí matching ‚Üí loading ‚Üí execution
   - Result: Skills are invisible, workflows get reinvented every time

### Why Current Instructions Fail

**Current AGENTS.md.template (lines 72-89)**:
```markdown
## Available Skills (Specialized Capabilities)

SpecWeave has specialized capabilities for different tasks:

{SKILLS_SECTION}

### How to Use Skills

**In Claude Code** (automatic):
- Skills activate based on keywords in your request
- No manual invocation needed

**In other tools** (manual):
- Read the skill file: `.claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`
- Follow the workflow described in that file
- Example: "Following increment-planner skill workflow..."
```

**Problems:**
1. ‚ùå No instruction to check skills BEFORE starting work
2. ‚ùå No discovery mechanism (how do I find the right skill?)
3. ‚ùå No matching algorithm (how do I know which skill to use?)
4. ‚ùå No progressive disclosure pattern (scan ‚Üí match ‚Üí load ‚Üí execute)
5. ‚ùå Treats skills as optional documentation, not mandatory expert manuals

### The Deeper Issue: Context Awareness

**Claude Code's advantage:**
- Pre-loads all skill metadata at startup
- Has ALL skills in "peripheral awareness"
- Can match user requests against activation keywords instantly
- Progressive disclosure happens automatically

**Other AI tools:**
- Start with ZERO knowledge of skills
- Only know what's in AGENTS.md (limited context window)
- Would need to read 34 SKILL.md files to discover all skills = massive token waste
- No efficient way to discover + match skills

---

## üß† The Solution: Simulating Progressive Disclosure

### Core Insight from Claude's Engineering Blog

From https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills:

> "At its simplest, a skill is a directory that contains a SKILL.md file. This file must start with YAML frontmatter that contains some required metadata: name and description. **At startup, the agent pre-loads the name and description of every installed skill into its system prompt.**
>
> This metadata is the **first level of progressive disclosure**: it provides just enough information for Claude to know when each skill should be used without loading all of it into context. The actual body of this file is the **second level of detail**. If Claude thinks the skill is relevant to the current task, it will load the skill by reading its full SKILL.md into context."

**Key Mechanism:**
1. **Level 1** (always loaded): Skill name + description (with activation keywords)
2. **Level 2** (on-demand): Full SKILL.md content

### How We Simulate This for Non-Native Tools

Since Copilot/Cursor/etc. can't pre-load skills at startup, we need to:

1. **Create a Skills Index** (`SKILLS-INDEX.md`)
   - Contains ALL skill names + descriptions + activation keywords
   - Single file, easy to scan (replaces 34 individual file reads)
   - Simulates Claude's "pre-loaded skill metadata"

2. **Update AGENTS.md with Explicit Workflow**
   - Step 1: Read SKILLS-INDEX.md (every session start)
   - Step 2: Match user request to activation keywords
   - Step 3: Load full SKILL.md for matches
   - Step 4: Follow skill's workflow

3. **Make Skills Discovery Mandatory**
   - Not "you can read skills" but "you MUST check skills first"
   - Position skills as authoritative expert manuals
   - Emphasize token savings and quality benefits

---

### 2. Updated AGENTS.md.template

**Location**: `src/templates/AGENTS.md.template`

**Changes**: Add new section BEFORE "Available Skills" (around line 70)

**New Section**:
```markdown
---

## üéØ CRITICAL: Skills Are Your Expert Manuals (Read First!)

**MANDATORY**: Before starting ANY implementation task, check for relevant skills.

### What Are Skills?

Skills are **specialized expert manuals** that contain:
- Proven workflows for specific tasks
- SpecWeave conventions and best practices
- Required files to read and tools to use
- Step-by-step instructions
- Examples and test cases

**There are 34 skills available covering**:
- Feature planning (increment-planner)
- External integrations (jira-sync, ado-sync, github-sync)
- Architecture & design (diagrams-architect, design-system-architect)
- Development (frontend, nodejs-backend, python-backend, nextjs)
- Quality & testing (increment-quality-judge, e2e-playwright)
- Infrastructure (hetzner-provisioner, cost-optimizer)
- Documentation (docusaurus, figma-to-code)

### Progressive Disclosure Pattern (How to Use Skills)

**STEP 1: Discovery (Always Start Here)**

Before starting ANY task, read the skills index:

```bash
cat .claude/skills/SKILLS-INDEX.md
```

This single file contains ALL available skills with their activation keywords.

**STEP 2: Matching**

Look for skills whose "Activates for" keywords match your current task:

| Your Task | Relevant Skill | Keywords |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| "Plan a new feature for user auth" | `increment-planner` | "feature planning", "create increment" |
| "Sync this to JIRA" | `jira-sync` | "JIRA sync", "create JIRA issue" |
| "Create architecture diagram" | `diagrams-architect` | "architecture diagram", "C4 diagram" |
| "Implement React component" | `frontend` | "React", "components", "UI" |
| "Deploy to cloud" | `hetzner-provisioner` or `cost-optimizer` | "deploy", "hosting", "infrastructure" |

**STEP 3: Load Full Skill**

Once you've identified 1-3 relevant skills, load their full documentation:

```bash
cat .claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md
```

**STEP 4: Execute Workflow**

Follow the skill's instructions precisely:
- Read required files listed in skill
- Use recommended tools
- Follow step-by-step workflow
- Apply best practices

### Why This Matters (Token Savings + Quality)

**Scenario**: User asks to plan a new feature

**Without skills** (bad):
```
‚ùå Read entire .specweave/docs/ folder (50k tokens)
‚ùå Guess at SpecWeave conventions
‚ùå Create inconsistent increment structure
‚ùå Miss context-manifest.yaml (no token savings)
‚ùå Reinvent workflow from scratch
```

**With skills** (good):
```
‚úÖ Read SKILLS-INDEX.md (2k tokens)
‚úÖ Match "plan feature" ‚Üí increment-planner skill
‚úÖ Load increment-planner SKILL.md (3k tokens)
‚úÖ Follow proven workflow with templates
‚úÖ Create proper context-manifest.yaml (70% token savings)
‚úÖ Total: 5k tokens vs 50k = 90% savings + higher quality
```

### Skills vs Agents (What's the Difference?)

**Skills = Capabilities (WHAT you can do)**
- increment-planner: Creates feature plans
- jira-sync: Syncs with external tools
- diagrams-architect: Creates diagrams

**Agents = Roles (WHO you become)**
- PM: Product manager perspective
- Architect: Technical design perspective
- DevOps: Infrastructure perspective

**When to use**:
- Use **skills** for workflows and procedures
- Use **agents** when you need to adopt a specific role/perspective

### For Non-Claude Code Users

**GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.:**

Since these tools don't have native skill support, you MUST:

1. **At session start**: Always read `SKILLS-INDEX.md`
2. **Before each task**: Check if relevant skills exist
3. **During execution**: Follow skill workflows precisely
4. **When stuck**: Re-read the relevant SKILL.md

**Treat this as mandatory**, not optional. Skills are the difference between:
- Inconsistent ad-hoc work ‚ùå
- Professional SpecWeave-compliant output ‚úÖ

---
```

**Position**: Insert around line 70, BEFORE "## Available Skills" section

**Key Changes**:
1. ‚úÖ Explicit "CRITICAL" and "MANDATORY" language
2. ‚úÖ Step-by-step progressive disclosure workflow
3. ‚úÖ Concrete examples of task ‚Üí skill matching
4. ‚úÖ Token savings explanation (numbers!)
5. ‚úÖ Emphasis on skills as expert manuals, not optional docs
6. ‚úÖ Special section for non-Claude tools

---

### 3. Skills Index Generator

**Location**: `src/utils/generate-skills-index.ts`

**Purpose**: Auto-generate SKILLS-INDEX.md from all SKILL.md files

**Algorithm**:
```typescript
1. Scan src/skills/**/SKILL.md
2. For each skill:
   a. Read file
   b. Parse YAML frontmatter (name, description, allowed-tools)
   c. Extract activation keywords from description
3. Group skills by category (framework, integrations, development, etc.)
4. Generate markdown with:
   - Header with total count
   - Progressive disclosure instructions
   - Full skill list with activation keywords
   - Category index
5. Write to src/skills/SKILLS-INDEX.md (template)
6. Copy to user's .claude/skills/ during init
```

**TypeScript Interface**:
```typescript
interface SkillMetadata {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  activationKeywords: string[];
  location: string;
  allowedTools?: string[];
  category: SkillCategory;
}

enum SkillCategory {
  FRAMEWORK = "Framework Core",
  INTEGRATIONS = "External Integrations",
  ARCHITECTURE = "Architecture & Design",
  DEVELOPMENT = "Development",
  QUALITY = "Quality & Testing",
  INFRASTRUCTURE = "Infrastructure",
  DOCUMENTATION = "Documentation",
  OTHER = "Other"
}

async function generateSkillsIndex(): Promise<void> {
  const skills: SkillMetadata[] = [];

  // Scan all SKILL.md files
  const skillFiles = await glob('src/skills/**/SKILL.md');

  for (const file of skillFiles) {
    const content = await fs.readFile(file, 'utf-8');
    const metadata = parseSkillMetadata(content, file);
    skills.push(metadata);
  }

  // Categorize skills
  const categorized = categorizeSkills(skills);

  // Generate markdown
  const markdown = generateIndexMarkdown(categorized);

  // Write to template location
  await fs.writeFile('src/skills/SKILLS-INDEX.md', markdown);

  console.log(`‚úÖ Generated SKILLS-INDEX.md with ${skills.length} skills`);
}
```

**Run**:
- During `specweave init`: Automatically
- Manually: `npm run generate-skills-index`
- In CI/CD: Pre-publish hook

---

### 4. Update init.ts

**Location**: `src/cli/commands/init.ts`

**Changes**: Add skills index generation step

```typescript
// After installing skills
await installSkills(targetDir);

// Generate skills index
console.log('Generating skills index...');
await generateSkillsIndex();

// Copy index to user's .claude/skills/
const indexPath = path.join(__dirname, '../../../src/skills/SKILLS-INDEX.md');
const targetIndexPath = path.join(targetDir, '.claude/skills/SKILLS-INDEX.md');
await fs.copy(indexPath, targetIndexPath);
console.log('‚úÖ Skills index installed');
```

---

## üéØ Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Skills Index Generator

**Tasks**:
1. Create `src/utils/generate-skills-index.ts`
2. Implement YAML parsing (extract name, description)
3. Implement keyword extraction (from "Activates for:" in description)
4. Implement categorization logic
5. Implement markdown generation
6. Add npm script: `"generate-skills-index": "ts-node src/utils/generate-skills-index.ts"`

**Test**:
```bash
npm run generate-skills-index
cat src/skills/SKILLS-INDEX.md  # Verify output
```

### Phase 2: Update AGENTS.md.template

**Tasks**:
1. Add new section "üéØ CRITICAL: Skills Are Your Expert Manuals"
2. Include progressive disclosure steps (Discovery ‚Üí Matching ‚Üí Load ‚Üí Execute)
3. Add examples table (task ‚Üí skill mapping)
4. Add token savings explanation
5. Add special note for non-Claude tools

**Test**:
```bash
# Run init to generate AGENTS.md with new section
specweave init --tool claude test-project/
cat test-project/AGENTS.md | grep "CRITICAL: Skills"  # Verify section exists
```

### Phase 3: Update init.ts

**Tasks**:
1. Import generateSkillsIndex function
2. Add skills index generation step after skill installation
3. Copy SKILLS-INDEX.md to user's .claude/skills/
4. Add success message

**Test**:
```bash
specweave init --tool claude test-project/
cat test-project/.claude/skills/SKILLS-INDEX.md  # Verify index exists
```

### Phase 4: Documentation Updates

**Tasks**:
1. Update CLAUDE.md (this file) to mention skills index
2. Update README.md with progressive disclosure explanation
3. Update docs-site/docs/guides/skills.md
4. Create ADR for progressive disclosure pattern

### Phase 5: Multi-Tool Testing

**Test with**:
1. ‚úÖ Claude Code (should still work, now has bonus SKILLS-INDEX.md)
2. ‚úÖ GitHub Copilot (test with SKILLS-INDEX.md in instructions.md)
3. ‚úÖ Cursor (test with SKILLS-INDEX.md reference in .cursorrules)
4. ‚úÖ Generic (test with SKILLS-INDEX.md in AGENTS.md)

**Validation**:
- AI tool reads SKILLS-INDEX.md
- AI tool correctly matches task to skill
- AI tool loads full SKILL.md
- AI tool follows skill workflow

---

## üí° Why This Will Work

### Root Cause Analysis

**Problem**: Non-Claude tools don't discover/use skills

**Root Causes**:
1. ‚ùå No native skill support in other tools
2. ‚ùå No efficient discovery mechanism (34 files to scan = too costly)
3. ‚ùå Vague instructions in AGENTS.md ("you can read skills")
4. ‚ùå Skills treated as optional, not mandatory

**Solution Mapping**:
1. ‚úÖ Simulate native support with SKILLS-INDEX.md (single-file metadata)
2. ‚úÖ Efficient discovery (1 file vs 34 files = 97% reduction)
3. ‚úÖ Explicit instructions with examples ("you MUST check skills first")
4. ‚úÖ Reframe as expert manuals, not docs ("CRITICAL", "MANDATORY")

### Expected Outcomes

**Before (current state)**:
- Non-Claude tools: 0% skill utilization
- Every session reinvents workflows
- Inconsistent increment structure
- Token waste on full .specweave/docs/ reads

**After (with progressive disclosure)**:
- Non-Claude tools: 80%+ skill utilization (with explicit instructions)
- Workflows followed from SKILL.md
- Consistent SpecWeave-compliant output
- Token savings from targeted skill loading

### Success Metrics

**Qualitative**:
- ‚úÖ AI tools read SKILLS-INDEX.md at session start
- ‚úÖ AI tools correctly match tasks to skills
- ‚úÖ AI tools load and follow skill workflows
- ‚úÖ Output matches SpecWeave conventions

**Quantitative**:
- Token usage: 90%+ reduction (5k vs 50k tokens)
- Consistency: 95%+ increments match proper structure
- Quality: 80%+ increments pass validation
- Developer satisfaction: Subjective, but measurable via feedback

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Implement skills index generator
2. **Next**: Update AGENTS.md.template with progressive disclosure
3. **Then**: Update init.ts to generate/copy index
4. **Finally**: Test with multiple AI tools

**Priority**: P1 (Critical for multi-tool compatibility)
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours
**Impact**: High (unlocks skills for all AI tools, not just Claude)
