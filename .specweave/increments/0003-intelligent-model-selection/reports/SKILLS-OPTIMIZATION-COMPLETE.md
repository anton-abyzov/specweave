# SpecWeave Skills Optimization & Plugin Integration - COMPLETE ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Duration**: ~45 minutes
**Status**: ✅ SUCCESS

---

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

### Phase 1: Skills Cleanup ✅

**Deleted** (8 skills, reducing bloat):
1. ❌ **context-optimizer** (589 lines)
   - Reason: Based on false architecture (assumed custom manifests that don't exist)
   - Conflicted with context-loader's accurate documentation

2. ❌ **Figma Cluster** (4 skills, 566 lines):
   - figma-designer
   - figma-implementer
   - figma-mcp-connector
   - figma-to-code
   - Reason: Over-engineered for spec-driven development, niche use case

3. ❌ **Empty Directories** (3 skills):
   - notification-system
   - stripe-integrator
   - calendar-system
   - Reason: No SKILL.md files, placeholder directories

**Moved to Internal** (2 skills):
- 📦 bmad-method-expert → `.claude/skills/` (competitive analysis only)
- 📦 spec-kit-expert → `.claude/skills/` (competitive analysis only)
- Reason: Only relevant for SpecWeave evaluation, not user projects

**Result**: Clean, focused skill set with clear purpose
