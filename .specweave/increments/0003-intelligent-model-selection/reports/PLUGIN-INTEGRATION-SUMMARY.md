- ✅ 3 agents: ml-engineer, mlops-engineer, data-scientist
- ✅ 1 command: /specweave.ml-pipeline

#### Phase 3: Observability & Monitoring 📊
- ✅ 4 skills: prometheus-configuration, grafana-dashboards, distributed-tracing, slo-implementation
- ✅ 4 agents: observability-engineer, performance-engineer, network-engineer, database-optimizer

---

## 🚀 How to Use New Features

### Kubernetes Deployment
\`\`\`bash
# Generate K8s manifests
"Create Kubernetes deployment for my Next.js app"
→ k8s-manifest-generator activates

# Create Helm chart
"Package this as a Helm chart"
→ helm-chart-scaffolding activates

# Setup GitOps
"Deploy with ArgoCD"
→ gitops-workflow activates
\`\`\`

### Machine Learning Pipeline
\`\`\`bash
# Full ML pipeline
/specweave.ml-pipeline "Customer churn prediction model"
→ Orchestrates 7 agents for complete ML lifecycle
\`\`\`

### Observability
\`\`\`bash
# Setup monitoring
/specweave.monitor-setup
→ Configures Prometheus + Grafana

# Implement SLOs
/specweave.slo-implement
→ Creates SLI/SLO/SLA definitions
\`\`\`

### TDD Workflow
\`\`\`bash
# Full TDD cycle
/specweave.tdd-cycle
→ Enforces red→green→refactor with gates

# Or just ask
"Implement with TDD"
→ tdd-workflow skill asks your preference
\`\`\`

### Payment Integration
\`\`\`bash
# Stripe integration
"Add Stripe payment processing"
→ stripe-integration skill activates

# PCI compliance
"Ensure PCI compliance"
→ pci-compliance skill guides you
\`\`\`
