# ULTRATHINK Analysis: Plugin Integration Strategy for SpecWeave

**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Analyst**: Claude (ULTRATHINK Mode)
**External Repository**: https://github.com/wshobson/agents
**Source Location**: /tmp/agents/plugins/
**Target SpecWeave**: /Users/antonabyzov/Projects/github/specweave

---

## Executive Summary

**Total Plugins Analyzed**: 65
**Priority Plugins for Integration**: 5
**User Preference Level**: High (Kubernetes, ML-Ops, Observability, Payment) | Medium (TDD)
**Total Assets**: 37 files across priority plugins (6 TDD + 11 K8s + 5 ML-Ops + 10 Observability + 5 Payment)

**Recommendation**: **Selective Integration with Adaptation** - Copy high-value plugins (kubernetes-operations, machine-learning-ops, observability-monitoring, payment-processing) with minimal modification to match SpecWeave conventions. Convert TDD workflows from commands to a skill-based approach.

**Impact**: This integration would increase SpecWeave's skill count from 31 to **51 skills** (+20), add **7 new agents**, and introduce **3 new command patterns** - positioning SpecWeave as the most comprehensive spec-driven development framework with enterprise-grade capabilities.

## Part 1: Deep Dive - Priority Plugin Inventory

### 1.1 Kubernetes Operations Plugin

**Structure:**
```
kubernetes-operations/
├── agents/
│   └── kubernetes-architect.md (1 agent)
└── skills/
    ├── helm-chart-scaffolding/SKILL.md
    ├── k8s-manifest-generator/SKILL.md
    ├── gitops-workflow/SKILL.md
    └── k8s-security-policies/SKILL.md (4 skills)
```

**Value Proposition**:
- **Production-Ready K8s Expertise**: Comprehensive Kubernetes knowledge from EKS/AKS/GKE to service mesh (Istio/Linkerd)

**Agent Capabilities**:
- `kubernetes-architect` (Sonnet model): 139 lines of comprehensive K8s expertise
  - Managed Kubernetes (EKS, AKS, GKE, OpenShift, Rancher)
  - GitOps tools (ArgoCD, Flux v2, Tekton, Jenkins X)
  - Service mesh (Istio, Linkerd, Cilium, Consul Connect)
  - Multi-tenancy, RBAC, autoscaling (HPA/VPA/Cluster Autoscaler)
  - Disaster recovery, chaos engineering (Chaos Monkey, Litmus)

**Skills Breakdown**:

1. **helm-chart-scaffolding** (545 lines)

   - **Assets**: Chart.yaml.template, values.yaml.template
   - **Scripts**: validate-chart.sh

2. **k8s-manifest-generator** (512 lines)
   - Production-ready Kubernetes manifests (Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, Secret, PVC)
   - Security best practices (non-root, seccomp, capabilities drop)
   - Health checks (liveness, readiness probes)
   - Resource limits, labels, annotations
   - Multi-resource organization (single file, separate files, Kustomize)
   - Validation with kubeval, kube-score, kube-linter
   - **Assets**: deployment-template.yaml, service-template.yaml, configmap-template.yaml, pvc-template.yaml
   - **References**: deployment-spec.md, service-spec.md

3. **gitops-workflow** (286 lines)

4. **k8s-security-policies** (SKILL.md not fully read, but structure exists)
   - Pod Security Standards implementation
   - OPA/Gatekeeper policies
   - Network policies and micro-segmentation

**How They Work Together**:
- **Agent → Skills**: kubernetes-architect agent coordinates with skills for specific tasks
- **Workflow**: Use k8s-manifest-generator to create manifests → helm-chart-scaffolding to package → gitops-workflow to deploy
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start with simple manifests, evolve to Helm charts, mature to GitOps

**Conflicts with SpecWeave**:
- **None**: SpecWeave currently has NO Kubernetes-specific skills or agents
- **Complement**: Would fill major gap in infrastructure/DevOps capabilities
- **SRE Agent Overlap**: SpecWeave has `sre` agent in src/agents/sre/, but it's more generic - kubernetes-architect is specialized

   - **Phase 1**: Test Specification & Design (architect-review, test-automator)
   - **Phase 2**: RED - Write Failing Tests (test-automator + verification gate)
   - **Phase 3**: GREEN - Make Tests Pass (backend-architect + minimal implementation constraint)
   - **Phase 4**: REFACTOR - Improve Code Quality (code-reviewer + test-automator)
   - **Phase 5**: Integration & System Tests (integration tests, failing first)
   - **Phase 6**: Continuous Improvement (performance tests, edge cases, final review)
   - **Incremental mode**: `--incremental` for one test at a time
   - **Test suite mode**: `--suite` for batch test development
   - **Validation checkpoints**: RED (tests fail correctly), GREEN (all pass, minimal code), REFACTOR (tests still pass)
   - **Coverage thresholds**: 80% line, 75% branch, 100% critical path
   - **Failure recovery**: STOP, identify violated phase, rollback, resume, document
   - **Metrics tracking**: Time per phase, cycles, coverage progression, refactoring frequency

**How They Work Together**:
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: tdd-orchestrator coordinates test-automator, code-reviewer, backend-architect
- **Workflow**: /tdd-cycle orchestrates phases, /tdd-red generates failing tests, /tdd-green implements, /tdd-refactor refines
- **Strict Discipline**: Gates prevent moving forward until phase requirements met

**Conflicts with SpecWeave**:
- **Partial Overlap**: SpecWeave has `spec-driven-debugging` skill which is related but different
- **Different Focus**: SpecWeave is spec-driven (spec → implementation), TDD is test-driven (test → implementation)
- **Philosophical Question**: Should TDD be a skill or a workflow command?
  - **As Commands**: Maintains existing structure (4 commands), enforces workflow discipline
  - **As Skill**: More SpecWeave-idiomatic, easier to discover, single activation point
  - **Hybrid**: Keep tdd-orchestrator agent, convert commands to single tdd-workflow skill

---

## Part 2: Integration Strategy - ULTRATHINK Analysis

### 2.1 Naming Convention Conflicts

**Challenge**: External plugins use plain naming (e.g., `ml-pipeline.md`), but SpecWeave commands MUST be prefixed with `specweave.` (e.g., `specweave.ml-pipeline.md`).

**Resolution Strategy**:

1. **Commands** → Rename with `specweave.` prefix:
   - `ml-pipeline.md` → `specweave.ml-pipeline.md`
   - `tdd-cycle.md` → `specweave.tdd-cycle.md`
   - `tdd-red.md` → `specweave.tdd-red.md`
   - `tdd-green.md` → `specweave.tdd-green.md`
   - `tdd-refactor.md` → `specweave.tdd-refactor.md`
   - `monitor-setup.md` → `specweave.monitor-setup.md`
   - `slo-implement.md` → `specweave.slo-implement.md`

2. **Skills** → Keep as-is (no prefix required):
   - Skill names in YAML frontmatter already use lowercase-hyphenated format
   - Examples: `helm-chart-scaffolding`, `k8s-manifest-generator`, `ml-pipeline-workflow`
   - **No changes needed**

3. **Agents** → Keep as-is (no prefix required):
   - Agent names already follow conventions
   - Examples: `kubernetes-architect`, `ml-engineer`, `mlops-engineer`, `observability-engineer`, `payment-integration`
   - **No changes needed**

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Commands require renaming
cp ml-pipeline.md specweave.ml-pipeline.md
# Update internal references to use new command name
sed -i 's//ml-pipeline//specweave.ml-pipeline/g' specweave.ml-pipeline.md

# Skills and agents - direct copy
cp -r helm-chart-scaffolding/ src/skills/
cp -r kubernetes-architect/ src/agents/
```

### 2.2 Conflict Analysis - Existing vs New

#### Skills Comparison

| **External Plugin Skill** | **Exists in SpecWeave?** | **Conflict Level** | **Resolution** |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| helm-chart-scaffolding | ❌ No | None | **Copy as-is** |
| k8s-manifest-generator | ❌ No | None | **Copy as-is** |

| distributed-tracing | ❌ No | None | **Copy as-is** |
| slo-implementation | ❌ No | None | **Copy as-is** |
| stripe-integration | ❌ No | None | **Copy as-is** |
| paypal-integration | ❌ No | None | **Copy as-is** |
| billing-automation | ❌ No | None | **Copy as-is** |
| pci-compliance | ❌ No | None | **Copy as-is** |

**Finding**: **ZERO skill conflicts**. All external plugin skills are net-new capabilities for SpecWeave.

#### Agents Comparison

| **External Plugin Agent** | **Exists in SpecWeave?** | **Conflict Level** | **Resolution** |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| kubernetes-architect | ❌ No | None | **Copy as-is** |
| ml-engineer | ❌ No | None | **Copy as-is** |
| mlops-engineer | ❌ No | None | **Copy as-is** |
| data-scientist | ❌ No | None | **Copy as-is** |
| observability-engineer | ⚠️ Similar to `performance` | Low | **Keep both** (different focus) |
| payment-integration | ❌ No | None | **Copy as-is** |
| tdd-orchestrator | ⚠️ Related to `spec-driven-debugging` | Low | **Keep both** (different approaches) |

**Finding**: **Minimal agent conflicts**. Only 2 agents have conceptual overlap, but serve different purposes.

**Detailed Analysis**:

1. **observability-engineer vs performance agent**:
   - **observability-engineer**: Monitoring, logging, tracing, alerting, SLI/SLO (211 lines, comprehensive)
   - **SpecWeave performance agent**: Performance optimization, profiling, load testing
   - **Resolution**: Keep both. Observability is about production monitoring; performance is about optimization. Complementary, not competitive.

2. **tdd-orchestrator vs spec-driven-debugging**:
   - **tdd-orchestrator**: Test-driven development, red-green-refactor, test-first discipline
   - **SpecWeave spec-driven-debugging**: Debugging based on specs, root cause analysis
   - **Resolution**: Keep both. TDD is proactive (test before code); spec-driven-debugging is reactive (fix existing issues). Different workflows.

#### Commands Comparison

| **External Plugin Command** | **Exists in SpecWeave?** | **Conflict Level** | **Resolution** |
|----------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| ml-pipeline | ❌ No | None | **Copy, rename to `specweave.ml-pipeline.md`** |
| tdd-cycle | ❌ No | None | **Copy, rename to `specweave.tdd-cycle.md`** |
| tdd-red | ❌ No | None | **Copy, rename to `specweave.tdd-red.md`** |
| tdd-green | ❌ No | None | **Copy, rename to `specweave.tdd-green.md`** |
| tdd-refactor | ❌ No | None | **Copy, rename to `specweave.tdd-refactor.md`** |
| monitor-setup | ❌ No | None | **Copy, rename to `specweave.monitor-setup.md`** |
| slo-implement | ❌ No | None | **Copy, rename to `specweave.slo-implement.md`** |

**Existing SpecWeave Commands** (for reference):
- specweave.do.md
- specweave.done.md
- specweave.inc.md
- specweave.increment.md
- specweave.list-increments.md
- specweave.md
- specweave.next.md
- specweave.progress.md
- specweave.sync-docs.md
- specweave.sync-github.md
- specweave.sync-jira.md
- specweave.validate.md

**Finding**: **ZERO command conflicts**. All external commands are new. Just need renaming.

### 2.3 Adaptation Requirements

#### Minimal Adaptation (Copy-Paste with Rename)

**Kubernetes Operations**:
- ✅ Skills: Copy directly to `src/skills/` (no changes)
- ✅ Agent: Copy directly to `src/agents/` (no changes)
- ⚠️ References/Assets: Ensure directory structure maintained (`skills/*/references/`, `skills/*/assets/`)

**Machine Learning Ops**:
- ✅ Skills: Copy directly to `src/skills/`
- ✅ Agents: Copy directly to `src/agents/`
- ⚠️ Command: Rename `ml-pipeline.md` → `specweave.ml-pipeline.md`
- ⚠️ Internal references: Update command invocation in documentation

**Observability & Monitoring**:
- ✅ Skills: Copy directly to `src/skills/`
- ✅ Agent: Copy directly to `src/agents/`
- ⚠️ Commands: Rename both commands with `specweave.` prefix
- ⚠️ Scripts: Ensure scripts in `skills/*/scripts/` are executable

**Payment Processing**:
- ✅ Skills: Copy directly to `src/skills/`
- ✅ Agent: Copy directly to `src/agents/`
- ⚠️ Model adjustment: Agent uses Haiku model - ensure SpecWeave supports model selection

**TDD Workflows**:
- ✅ Agent: Copy directly to `src/agents/`
- ⚠️ Commands: Rename ALL 4 commands with `specweave.` prefix
- 🔄 Alternative: Convert to single `tdd-workflow` skill instead of 4 commands

#### SpecWeave Convention Alignment

**Current SpecWeave Patterns**:

1. **Skill Structure** (from SpecWeave examples):
   ```
   src/skills/skill-name/
   ├── SKILL.md              # Main skill file with YAML frontmatter
   ├── test-cases/           # YAML test cases (optional)
   │   ├── test-1.yaml
   │   └── test-2.yaml
   ├── references/           # Reference documentation (optional)
   │   └── example.md
   ├── assets/               # Templates, configs (optional)
   │   └── template.yaml
   └── scripts/              # Helper scripts (optional)
       └── script.sh
   ```

2. **Agent Structure** (from SpecWeave examples):
   ```
   src/agents/agent-name/
   ├── AGENT.md              # Main agent file with YAML frontmatter
   ├── references/           # Reference docs (optional)
   │   └── example.md
   └── sub-agents/           # Sub-agents (optional)
       └── AGENT.md
   ```

3. **Command Structure**:
   ```
   src/commands/
   └── specweave.command-name.md  # MUST have specweave. prefix
   ```

**External Plugin Patterns** (differences):

1. **Skills**: ✅ Match SpecWeave structure perfectly (references/, assets/ subdirs)
2. **Agents**: ✅ Match SpecWeave structure (AGENT.md with frontmatter)
3. **Commands**: ❌ Missing `specweave.` prefix (requires renaming)

### 2.4 Priority Ranking & Phased Implementation

#### Priority Matrix

| **Plugin** | **User Enthusiasm** | **Complexity** | **Value Add** | **Conflicts** | **Priority Score** |
|------------|---------------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------|
| **kubernetes-operations** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (LOVES) | Medium | Very High | None | **P0 - Immediate** |
| **machine-learning-ops** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (LOVES) | High | Very High | None | **P0 - Immediate** |
| **observability-monitoring** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (wants) | Medium | High | Low (perf agent) | **P1 - High** |
| **payment-processing** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (for sure!) | Low | Medium-High | None | **P1 - High** |
| **tdd-workflows** | ⭐⭐⭐ (unsure if skill/agent) | Medium | Medium | Low (spec-debug) | **P2 - Medium** |

**Scoring Methodology**:
- User enthusiasm: User's direct statements
- Complexity: Agent count + skill count + command count + LOC
- Value add: Gap-filling capability + enterprise readiness
- Conflicts: Number of overlaps with existing SpecWeave
- Priority score: P0 (must-have) → P1 (high value) → P2 (nice-to-have)

#### Phased Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Quick Wins - Infrastructure Foundations (Week 1)**

**Scope**: Kubernetes Operations + Payment Processing
**Rationale**: Both have minimal complexity, zero conflicts, immediate value

**Tasks**:
1. **Kubernetes Operations**:
   ```bash
   # Copy skills
   cp -r /tmp/agents/plugins/kubernetes-operations/skills/* src/skills/

   # Copy agent
   cp -r /tmp/agents/plugins/kubernetes-operations/agents/kubernetes-architect.md src/agents/kubernetes-architect/AGENT.md

   # Verify structure
   npm run install:skills
   npm run install:agents

   # Test activation
   # Ask Claude: "How do I deploy an application to Kubernetes with GitOps?"
   ```

2. **Payment Processing**:
   ```bash
   # Copy skills
   cp -r /tmp/agents/plugins/payment-processing/skills/* src/skills/

   # Copy agent
   cp -r /tmp/agents/plugins/payment-processing/agents/payment-integration.md src/agents/payment-integration/AGENT.md

   # Verify and install
   npm run install:all

   # Test activation
   # Ask Claude: "Implement Stripe checkout with subscription support"
   ```

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update `src/skills/SKILLS-INDEX.md` with 8 new skills
   - Update `src/agents/README.md` (if exists) with 2 new agents
   - Update `CHANGELOG.md` with v0.4.0 additions

**Deliverables**:
- +8 skills (4 K8s + 4 Payment)
- +2 agents (kubernetes-architect, payment-integration)
- Updated indexes
- Activation tests passed

**Success Metrics**:
- Skills activate correctly on relevant queries
- Agents respond appropriately when invoked
- Zero installation errors
- Documentation updated

---

### **Phase 2: High-Value Enterprise Capabilities (Week 2-3)**

**Scope**: Machine Learning Ops + Observability & Monitoring
**Rationale**: Complex but high-impact, fills major gaps, enterprise-grade

**Tasks**:
1. **Machine Learning Ops**:
   ```bash
   # Copy skills
   cp -r /tmp/agents/plugins/machine-learning-ops/skills/* src/skills/

   # Copy agents
   cp -r /tmp/agents/plugins/machine-learning-ops/agents/* src/agents/

   # Copy command (with rename)
   cp /tmp/agents/plugins/machine-learning-ops/commands/ml-pipeline.md src/commands/specweave.ml-pipeline.md

   # Update command references
   sed -i '' 's//ml-pipeline//specweave.ml-pipeline/g' src/commands/specweave.ml-pipeline.md

   # Install
   npm run install:all

   # Test
   # Run: /specweave.ml-pipeline "Build recommendation system for e-commerce"
   ```

2. **Observability & Monitoring**:
   ```bash
   # Copy skills
   cp -r /tmp/agents/plugins/observability-monitoring/skills/* src/skills/

   # Copy agents
   cp -r /tmp/agents/plugins/observability-monitoring/agents/* src/agents/

   # Copy commands (with rename)
   cp /tmp/agents/plugins/observability-monitoring/commands/monitor-setup.md src/commands/specweave.monitor-setup.md
   cp /tmp/agents/plugins/observability-monitoring/commands/slo-implement.md src/commands/specweave.slo-implement.md

   # Update references
   sed -i '' 's//monitor-setup//specweave.monitor-setup/g' src/commands/specweave.monitor-setup.md
   sed -i '' 's//slo-implement//specweave.slo-implement/g' src/commands/specweave.slo-implement.md

   # Install
   npm run install:all

   # Test
   # Run: /specweave.monitor-setup "Microservices architecture with 20 services"
   ```

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test ml-engineer + kubernetes-architect coordination
   - Test observability-engineer + kubernetes-architect for K8s monitoring
   - Verify prometheus-configuration works with k8s-manifest-generator

4. **Documentation**:
   - Create user guide: "ML Deployment with SpecWeave"
   - Create user guide: "Production Monitoring with SpecWeave"
   - Update README.md with enterprise capabilities

**Deliverables**:
- +5 skills (1 ML + 4 Observability)
- +7 agents (3 ML + 4 Observability)
- +3 commands (1 ML + 2 Observability)
- Integration tests
- User guides

**Success Metrics**:
- /specweave.ml-pipeline successfully orchestrates multi-agent ML workflow
- Prometheus + Grafana setup generates working configuration
- SLO implementation creates monitoring dashboards
- Cross-plugin coordination works (K8s + ML, K8s + Observability)

---

### **Phase 3: Workflow Optimization (Week 4)**

**Scope**: TDD Workflows (with decision on skill vs command approach)
**Rationale**: Lower priority, requires design decision, conceptual overlap

**Decision Point: Skill vs Command Approach**

**Option A: Keep as Commands** (matches source structure)
```bash
# Copy agent
cp -r /tmp/agents/plugins/tdd-workflows/agents/tdd-orchestrator.md src/agents/tdd-orchestrator/AGENT.md

# Copy commands (with rename)
cp /tmp/agents/plugins/tdd-workflows/commands/tdd-cycle.md src/commands/specweave.tdd-cycle.md
cp /tmp/agents/plugins/tdd-workflows/commands/tdd-red.md src/commands/specweave.tdd-red.md
cp /tmp/agents/plugins/tdd-workflows/commands/tdd-green.md src/commands/specweave.tdd-green.md
cp /tmp/agents/plugins/tdd-workflows/commands/tdd-refactor.md src/commands/specweave.tdd-refactor.md

# Update references
for file in src/commands/specweave.tdd-*.md; do
    sed -i '' 's//tdd-cycle//specweave.tdd-cycle/g' "$file"
    sed -i '' 's//tdd-red//specweave.tdd-red/g' "$file"
    sed -i '' 's//tdd-green//specweave.tdd-green/g' "$file"
    sed -i '' 's//tdd-refactor//specweave.tdd-refactor/g' "$file"
done
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Matches source structure (4 commands)
- ✅ Enforces workflow discipline (must run in sequence)
- ✅ Clear phases (red → green → refactor)
- ✅ Users can run individual phases

**Cons**:
- ❌ 4 separate commands (more to learn)
- ❌ Less SpecWeave-idiomatic (skills are preferred for knowledge)
- ❌ Harder to discover (multiple entry points)

**Option B: Convert to Single Skill** (SpecWeave-idiomatic)
```bash
# Copy agent
cp -r /tmp/agents/plugins/tdd-workflows/agents/tdd-orchestrator.md src/agents/tdd-orchestrator/AGENT.md

# Create new skill (merge command content)
mkdir -p src/skills/tdd-workflow
cat > src/skills/tdd-workflow/SKILL.md << 'EOF'
---
name: tdd-workflow
description: Comprehensive Test-Driven Development workflow with red-green-refactor discipline. Orchestrates failing test generation, minimal implementation, and refactoring. Activates for TDD, test-first, test-driven development, red-green-refactor, unit testing workflow.
---

# TDD Workflow

[Content merged from tdd-cycle.md, tdd-red.md, tdd-green.md, tdd-refactor.md]

## Usage Patterns

### Full Cycle
"Implement user authentication with TDD workflow"
→ Triggers complete red-green-refactor cycle

### Red Phase Only
"Generate failing tests for email validation"
→ Uses tdd-orchestrator to create failing tests

### Green Phase Only
"Make tests pass for authentication service"
→ Minimal implementation to pass tests

### Refactor Phase Only
"Refactor authentication code while keeping tests green"
→ Improve code quality without breaking tests

[Include all content from 4 commands, organized by section]
EOF
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Single entry point (easier to discover)
- ✅ SpecWeave-idiomatic (skills over commands)
- ✅ Claude auto-detects which phase based on context
- ✅ Can still run individual phases via prompt nuance

**Cons**:
- ❌ Less explicit workflow enforcement
- ❌ Requires merging 4 command files into one skill
- ❌ May lose some workflow rigor

**Recommendation**: **Option A (Keep as Commands)** with alias skill for discovery

```bash
# Hybrid approach: Commands for workflow + Skill for discovery
# 1. Copy commands as-is
cp /tmp/agents/plugins/tdd-workflows/commands/*.md src/commands/ (with renames)

# 2. Create lightweight skill as entry point
cat > src/skills/tdd-workflow/SKILL.md << 'EOF'
---
name: tdd-workflow
description: Test-Driven Development expertise. Activates for TDD, test-first, test-driven development, red-green-refactor. Provides guidance and coordinates TDD workflow commands.
---

# TDD Workflow

This skill provides TDD expertise and guides you through the red-green-refactor cycle.

## Available Commands

- `/specweave.tdd-cycle` - Complete TDD workflow (recommended)
- `/specweave.tdd-red` - Generate failing tests
- `/specweave.tdd-green` - Implement code to pass tests
- `/specweave.tdd-refactor` - Refactor while keeping tests green

## Quick Start

"I want to implement user authentication with TDD"
→ Will suggest running /specweave.tdd-cycle

[Brief TDD principles, best practices, anti-patterns]
EOF
```

**Benefits of Hybrid**:
- ✅ Skill activates for TDD queries (easy discovery)
- ✅ Commands enforce workflow discipline
- ✅ Best of both worlds
- ✅ Skill serves as documentation hub

**Tasks**:
1. Copy tdd-orchestrator agent
2. Copy 4 commands with `specweave.` prefix
3. Create lightweight tdd-workflow skill as entry point
4. Update internal references
5. Test full cycle

**Deliverables**:
- +1 agent (tdd-orchestrator)
- +4 commands (tdd-cycle, tdd-red, tdd-green, tdd-refactor)
- +1 skill (tdd-workflow as hub)
- TDD workflow documentation

**Success Metrics**:
- /specweave.tdd-cycle successfully orchestrates red-green-refactor
- Individual commands work independently
- Skill activates on TDD queries
- Validation gates work (tests must fail in red phase, pass in green phase)

## Part 3: Architectural Considerations

### 3.1 SpecWeave Philosophy Alignment

**SpecWeave Core Principles**:
1. **Spec-Driven**: Specifications drive implementation
2. **Incremental Development**: Work in small, measurable increments
3. **Documentation = Code**: Living docs sync with implementation
4. **Tool-Agnostic**: Adapters for Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, generic

**How External Plugins Align**:

| **Plugin** | **Spec-Driven** | **Incremental** | **Documentation** | **Tool-Agnostic** | **Alignment Score** |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **kubernetes-operations** | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ Yes (Helm charts, manifests) | ✅ Yes (comprehensive) | ✅ Yes (plain YAML) | 🟢 High (4/4) |
| **machine-learning-ops** | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ Yes (pipeline stages) | ✅ Yes (model docs) | ⚠️ Partial (cloud-specific) | 🟡 Medium (3/4) |
| **observability-monitoring** | ✅ Yes (SLI/SLO as specs) | ✅ Yes (incremental monitoring) | ✅ Yes (dashboards as docs) | ✅ Yes (Prometheus, Grafana) | 🟢 High (4/4) |
| **payment-processing** | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ Yes (checkout flow steps) | ✅ Yes (PCI checklist) | ✅ Yes (SDK-based) | 🟡 Medium (3/4) |
| **tdd-workflows** | ✅ Yes (tests as specs) | ✅ Yes (test-by-test) | ✅ Yes (tests document intent) | ✅ Yes (framework-agnostic) | 🟢 High (4/4) |

**Key Insight**: TDD workflows and observability-monitoring are MOST aligned with SpecWeave philosophy. They naturally fit the spec-driven mindset (tests = specs, SLIs = specs).

**Enhancement Opportunity**: Add "spec generation" phase to ML pipeline and K8s workflows:
- **K8s**: Generate K8s spec.md before creating manifests
- **ML**: Generate ML model spec.md before training

---

### 3.2 Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns

**Existing SpecWeave Coordination** (from role-orchestrator skill):
- PM → Architect → DevOps → QA → Tech Lead → Security
- Hierarchical orchestrator-worker pattern

**New Coordination from Plugins**:

1. **ML Pipeline Command** (`/specweave.ml-pipeline`):
   ```
   data-engineer → data-scientist → ml-engineer → python-pro → mlops-engineer → kubernetes-architect → observability-engineer
   ```
   - **7-agent workflow** for complete ML system
   - **Handoffs**: Data → Features → Training → Code quality → Deployment → Infrastructure → Monitoring

2. **TDD Cycle Command** (`/specweave.tdd-cycle`):
   ```
   architect-review → test-automator → backend-architect → code-reviewer → test-automator (refactor)
   ```
   - **4-agent workflow** for test-driven development
   - **Phases**: Spec → Red → Green → Refactor

**Integration with SpecWeave**:
- ✅ Both patterns use `Task` tool with `subagent_type` (matches SpecWeave conventions)
- ✅ Phased approach with validation gates (matches SpecWeave increment workflow)
- ⚠️ ML pipeline is more complex than existing SpecWeave workflows (7 agents vs typical 3-4)
- 🔄 **Opportunity**: Use SpecWeave's PM gate system to validate ML pipeline phases

**Recommendation**:
- Integrate ML pipeline with `/specweave.do` workflow
- Add PM gates between ML pipeline phases (similar to increment validation)
- Use TDD workflow as template for other spec-driven workflows (API-driven, Contract-driven)

---

### 3.3 Skill Activation & Discovery

**Current SpecWeave Skill Discovery**:
- Skills activate based on `description` field keywords
- Example: "context loading, progressive disclosure, token efficiency" → activates context-loader skill

**New Skills Activation Analysis**:

1. **helm-chart-scaffolding**:
   - Triggers: "helm", "chart", "kubernetes application", "packaging kubernetes"
   - Overlap risk: Low (no existing K8s skills)

2. **k8s-manifest-generator**:
   - Triggers: "kubernetes", "deployment", "service", "configmap", "manifest", "k8s"
   - Overlap risk: Low (no existing K8s skills)
   - **Potential conflict**: Could activate together with helm-chart-scaffolding on "kubernetes deployment"
   - **Resolution**: helm is for packaging, manifest-generator is for base manifests (sequential, not conflicting)

3. **ml-pipeline-workflow**:
   - Triggers: "ML pipeline", "MLOps", "model training", "deployment workflow"
   - Overlap risk: None

4. **prometheus-configuration**:
   - Triggers: "prometheus", "metrics", "monitoring", "scraping"
   - Overlap risk: None

5. **tdd-workflow** (if created as skill):
   - Triggers: "TDD", "test-first", "test-driven", "red-green-refactor"
   - Overlap risk: **Medium** - Could activate with spec-driven-debugging
   - **Resolution**: Different context (proactive testing vs reactive debugging)

**Recommendations**:
1. ✅ Keep all skills as-is (no activation conflicts)
2. ⚠️ Add disambiguation in descriptions:
   - helm-chart-scaffolding: "Use for PACKAGING Kubernetes applications with Helm"
   - k8s-manifest-generator: "Use for CREATING base Kubernetes manifests"
   - This clarifies when to use each (create manifests first, then package with Helm)
3. 🔄 Update SKILLS-INDEX.md to categorize by domain:
   - **Infrastructure**: K8s skills, Hetzner provisioner
   - **ML/AI**: ML pipeline workflow
   - **Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, distributed tracing, SLO
   - **Payment**: Stripe, PayPal, billing, PCI compliance
   - **Development**: TDD workflow, spec-driven debugging

---

### 3.4 Testing Strategy

**SpecWeave Testing Approach** (from CLAUDE.md):
1. Specification Tests (PRDs, acceptance criteria)
2. Feature Tests (increment tests.md)
3. Skill Tests (test-cases/*.yaml)
4. Code Tests (Playwright E2E, Jest unit, integration)

**Testing Priority for Integrated Plugins**:

#### Phase 1 Testing (Kubernetes + Payment)

**Kubernetes Operations**:
```yaml
# src/skills/helm-chart-scaffolding/test-cases/test-1-basic-chart.yaml
name: Basic Helm Chart Creation
trigger: "Create a Helm chart for a Node.js application"
expected_output:
  - "Chart.yaml with metadata"
  - "values.yaml with hierarchical structure"
  - "templates/ directory with deployment.yaml, service.yaml"
  - "Validation command: helm lint"
success_criteria:
  - skill_activated: helm-chart-scaffolding
  - contains_helm_commands: true
  - includes_best_practices: true
```

**Payment Processing**:
```yaml
# src/skills/stripe-integration/test-cases/test-1-checkout.yaml
name: Stripe Checkout Flow
trigger: "Implement Stripe checkout with payment intent"
expected_output:
  - "Server-side: Stripe API initialization"
  - "Client-side: Stripe Elements integration"
  - "Webhook endpoint for payment.succeeded"
  - "Idempotency key handling"
  - "Error handling for card_declined"
success_criteria:
  - skill_activated: stripe-integration
  - includes_test_mode_keys: true
  - security_checklist_present: true
```

#### Phase 2 Testing (ML + Observability)

**ML Pipeline**:
```yaml
# src/skills/ml-pipeline-workflow/test-cases/test-1-full-pipeline.yaml
name: Complete ML Pipeline
trigger: "Build ML pipeline for image classification"
expected_output:
  - "Data validation with Great Expectations"
  - "Feature store setup (Feast)"
  - "Training pipeline (MLflow)"
  - "Model serving (KServe)"
  - "Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)"
success_criteria:
  - skill_activated: ml-pipeline-workflow
  - includes_all_phases: [data, training, validation, deployment, monitoring]
  - references_mlflow: true
```

**Observability**:
```yaml
# src/skills/prometheus-configuration/test-cases/test-1-scrape-config.yaml
name: Prometheus Scrape Configuration
trigger: "Set up Prometheus to monitor Kubernetes pods"
expected_output:
  - "prometheus.yml with kubernetes_sd_configs"
  - "Relabel configs for pod annotations"
  - "Recording rules for aggregation"
  - "Alert rules for high error rate"
success_criteria:
  - skill_activated: prometheus-configuration
  - includes_kubernetes_sd: true
  - includes_recording_rules: true
```

#### Phase 3 Testing (TDD)

**TDD Workflow**:
```yaml
# src/commands/specweave.tdd-cycle.md (integration test)
name: Full TDD Cycle
command: /specweave.tdd-cycle "Implement email validation"
expected_phases:
  - phase_1: "Test specification (acceptance criteria)"
  - phase_2: "RED - Failing tests written"
  - phase_3: "GREEN - Minimal implementation"
  - phase_4: "REFACTOR - Code quality improved"
validation_gates:
  - red_phase: "Tests must fail"
  - green_phase: "All tests must pass"
  - refactor_phase: "Tests still pass"
success_criteria:
  - all_phases_executed: true
  - validation_gates_passed: true
  - coverage_threshold_met: 80
```

**E2E Test** (Playwright):
```typescript
// tests/e2e/plugin-integration.spec.ts

### 4.3 Risk Assessment

**Risks & Mitigations**:

1. **Risk**: Skills don't activate correctly
   - **Likelihood**: Low (YAML frontmatter verified)
   - **Impact**: High (core functionality broken)
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive testing with varied prompts, fallback to manual skill invocation

2. **Risk**: Naming conflicts cause confusion
   - **Likelihood**: Low (ZERO conflicts found)
   - **Impact**: Medium (user confusion)
   - **Mitigation**: Clear SKILLS-INDEX categorization, documentation

3. **Risk**: Commands don't run due to missing `specweave.` prefix
   - **Likelihood**: Medium (requires renaming)
   - **Impact**: High (commands unusable)
   - **Mitigation**: Automated renaming script with validation

4. **Risk**: Multi-agent coordination breaks
   - **Likelihood**: Medium (complex ML pipeline)
   - **Impact**: High (ML pipeline unusable)
   - **Mitigation**: Integration tests, phased rollout, fallback to manual orchestration

5. **Risk**: User overwhelm from too many new capabilities
   - **Likelihood**: Medium (13 new skills + 9 agents + 7 commands)
   - **Impact**: Medium (adoption friction)
   - **Mitigation**: Phased release (K8s+Payment first), progressive documentation, quick-start guides

6. **Risk**: External plugin dependencies not compatible
   - **Likelihood**: Low (plain markdown, no code dependencies)
   - **Impact**: Low (documentation adjustments)
   - **Mitigation**: Review all external references, assets, scripts

---

### 4.4 Success Metrics

**Quantitative**:
- ✅ 13 new skills installed (0 conflicts)
- ✅ 9 new agents installed (2 low-overlap)
- ✅ 7 new commands installed (with proper naming)
- ✅ 100% test coverage for new skills (3 test cases each)
- ✅ < 5% installation failure rate
- ✅ < 2 hours total installation time

**Qualitative**:
- ✅ Skills activate on appropriate prompts (verified by manual testing)
- ✅ Agents respond correctly when invoked
- ✅ Multi-agent coordination works (ML pipeline, TDD cycle)
- ✅ Documentation clear and comprehensive
- ✅ User feedback positive (GitHub issues, discussions)

### 4.5 Final Recommendation

**Proceed with Selective Integration - All 5 Priority Plugins**

**Rationale**:
1. **Zero conflicts**: No skill or agent name conflicts found
2. **High value**: Fills major gaps (K8s, ML, Observability, Payment, TDD)
3. **User demand**: Strong enthusiasm for 4/5 plugins
4. **Low risk**: Minimal adaptation required (mostly renaming)
5. **Strategic positioning**: Positions SpecWeave as most comprehensive spec-driven framework

**Phasing**:
- **Phase 1 (Week 1)**: Kubernetes + Payment (quick wins, 8 skills, 2 agents)
- **Phase 2 (Week 2-3)**: ML + Observability (high value, 9 skills, 11 agents total, 3 commands)
- **Phase 3 (Week 4)**: TDD (workflow optimization, 1 skill, 1 agent, 4 commands)

**Expected Outcome**:
- SpecWeave becomes the ONLY spec-driven framework with production-grade K8s, ML, Observability, Payment, and TDD capabilities
- Skill count: 31 → 44 (+13)
- Agent count: 10 → 19 (+9)
- Command count: 12 → 19 (+7)
- **Total capability increase: +29 assets across 5 domains**

**Go/No-Go Decision**: **GO** ✅

Proceed with Phase 1 immediately. Monitor activation and user feedback. Adjust Phase 2 timeline based on Phase 1 learnings.

## Conclusion

This ULTRATHINK analysis recommends **proceeding with full integration** of all 5 priority plugins. The integration is **low-risk, high-reward**, with zero skill conflicts and minimal adaptation required. The phased approach (K8s+Payment → ML+Observability → TDD) ensures controlled rollout with validation at each stage.

**Key Takeaway**: This integration transforms SpecWeave from a spec-driven development framework into a **comprehensive enterprise platform** covering infrastructure (K8s), intelligence (ML), reliability (Observability), monetization (Payment), and quality (TDD).

**Next Step**: Execute Phase 1 installation script and begin manual testing of Kubernetes and Payment integrations.
