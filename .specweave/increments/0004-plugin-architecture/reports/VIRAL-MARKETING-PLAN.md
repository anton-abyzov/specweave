## Pre-Launch (7 Days Before Video)

### Day -7 to -4: Seed the Conversation

#### Twitter Thread Series (Daily)

**Thread 1: The Problem**
```
I spent 6 months analyzing why dev teams fail at spec-driven development.

The answer isn't what you think.

Thread 🧵 (1/10)

---

Most teams think specs fail because:
- Developers hate writing docs
- Product requirements change too fast
- Documentation becomes outdated

All wrong. (2/10)

---

The real problem: Specs are treated as **documentation**.

They should be **executable infrastructure**.

Like CI/CD for your requirements. (3/10)

---

BMAD Method got close. Brilliant research framework.

But it's manual. Every artifact handcrafted.

It's like writing a PhD thesis for every feature. (4/10)

---

SpecKit by @denniscode nailed the simplicity.

Markdown templates. Zero lock-in.

But it's just scaffolding. No automation. (5/10)

---

What if specs:
- Updated themselves automatically
- Stayed in sync with code
- Enforced quality gates
- Reduced AI context by 76%

Without you thinking about it? (6/10)

---

I built it. It's called SpecWeave.

Open source. MIT license.

Video drops Friday. (7/10)

---

Here's a preview: hooks fire after EVERY task.

Docs sync automatically.

You never break flow. (8/10)

[Insert: GIF of hook firing, docs updating]

---

Plugin system: load only what you need.

React app: 12K tokens (not 50K).

76% context reduction = 4x more space for YOUR code. (9/10)

---

Friday's video: 5 greenfield demos + brownfield migration.

Why this destroys manual frameworks.

Drop a 🔥 if you want early access. (10/10)

GitHub: [link]
```

**Thread 2: The Controversy**
```
Unpopular opinion:

BMAD Method is brilliant.

And obsolete.

Here's why 👇 (1/8)

---

BMAD forces you to think deeply.

Market analysis. Competitive research. User stories.

This is GOOD. (2/8)

---

But it's 2025.

AI can do 80% of this research in 5 minutes.

BMAD makes you do it manually. (3/8)

---

SpecKit is the opposite: ultra-lightweight.

"Just use Markdown templates."

Great for tiny teams. Terrible for scale. (4/8)

---

Both miss the key insight:

Specs aren't **documents**. They're **infrastructure**.

They should update themselves. (5/8)

---

What if:
- AI researches markets (you validate)
- Specs sync with code automatically
- Hooks enforce quality gates
- Living docs stay current

Without manual work? (6/8)

---

That's SpecWeave.

Open source. MIT license.

Takes BMAD's rigor + SpecKit's simplicity.

Adds automation. (7/8)

---

Video Friday. I build 5 projects greenfield + migrate a brownfield mess.

@denniscode thoughts? (8/8)

### Day -3: Influencer Outreach

#### Den Delimarsky (SpecKit Creator)

**Twitter DM**:
```
Hey Den! Huge fan of SpecKit—you nailed the "keep it simple" philosophy.

I built something that extends your vision: automated living docs + plugin system.

Would love your thoughts before I launch publicly on Friday.

GitHub: [link]
Quick demo: [Loom video, 2 min]

No pressure—just respect your work and wanted to share.
```

**Why this works**:
- Genuine compliment (he DID nail simplicity)
- Low-pressure ask (just "thoughts")
- Shows respect (not positioning as competitor)
- If he engages → massive credibility boost

#### BMAD Method Creator (if identifiable)

**Email**:
```
Subject: Automated your methodology—feedback welcome

Hi [Name],

BMAD Method inspired my thesis: specs should drive development.

I spent 6 months building an automated version:
- Your research rigor (AI-assisted, human-validated)
- Your artifact structure (spec/plan/tasks)
- Added: Hooks, living docs, quality gates

Open source, MIT license. Would love your feedback.

GitHub: [link]
Video demo: [Loom, 3 min]

No commercial ask—just gratitude for the methodology.

Best,
Anton
```

**Why this works**:
- Positions as "standing on their shoulders"
- No commercial threat (open source)
- Appeals to legacy (their methodology lives on)
- If they respond → instant credibility

#### Dev YouTubers (ThePrimeagen, Theo, Fireship, etc.)

**Twitter**:
```
@[influencer] Built a framework that makes specs executable infrastructure.

Controversial take: BMAD is brilliant but obsolete. SpecKit is simple but incomplete.

76% context reduction for AI coding. Automated living docs.

Worth a reaction video?

Video drops Friday: [link]
```

**Why this works**:
- Controversy = engagement
- Clear value prop (76% reduction)
- Easy content for them (reaction video)
- If they bite → 100K+ views minimum

---

### Day -1: Final Tease

#### Twitter

```
24 hours until I show you why your docs are lies.

And how to make them tell the truth.

5 projects built from scratch.
1 brownfield mess cleaned up.
100% automated living documentation.

Tomorrow, 10 AM EST.

Drop a ⭐ if you're ready: [GitHub link]
```

#### Reddit (r/programming)

**Title**: "I automated spec-driven development. Video drops tomorrow."

**Body**:
```
For the last 6 months, I've been building SpecWeave—a framework that makes specs executable infrastructure instead of dead docs.

The insight: Traditional specs fail because they're **manual**. BMAD is brilliant but every artifact is handcrafted. SpecKit is simple but just templates.

SpecWeave: Automated living docs. Hooks fire after every task. Docs sync themselves. 76% context reduction for AI coding.

Tomorrow's video:

**Twitter Thread**:
```
🚀 SpecWeave just dropped.

I built 5 projects + migrated a brownfield mess.

76% less AI context. 100% automated docs.

Why BMAD and SpecKit aren't enough.

Watch 👇 (1/7)

---

[YouTube link]

TL;DR:
- BMAD: Brilliant, but manual
- SpecKit: Simple, but just templates
- SpecWeave: Automated living specs (2/7)

---

Plugin system loads ONLY what you need:

React app: 12K tokens (not 50K)
K8s project: 17K tokens (not 50K)

76% context reduction = 4x more space for YOUR code. (3/7)

---

Hooks fire after EVERY task:
✅ Log completion
✅ Update progress
✅ Sync docs automatically
✅ Play completion sound (yes, really)

You never think about documentation. It just happens. (4/7)

---

Demos in video:
1️⃣ Stock portfolio (React + real-time)
2️⃣ Blockchain monitor (TDD mode)
3️⃣ AI task manager (with Quality Judge)

After 6 months of development, SpecWeave is live.

It's an open-source framework that solves a problem every dev team has but nobody talks about: specs that actually work.

The insight: Specs aren't documentation. They're executable infrastructure.

In today's video, I build 5 projects from scratch and migrate a brownfield mess—all with automated living docs.

Key features:
✅ 76% context reduction for AI coding (plugin system)
✅ Automated doc sync (hooks fire after every task)
✅ Quality gates enforced (no "we'll fix it later")
✅ Brownfield migration support (gradual spec adoption)

Title: SpecWeave: Automated spec-driven development (76% context reduction, living docs, open source)

Body:
I just released SpecWeave—a framework that makes specs executable infrastructure instead of dead docs.

The problem: Traditional specs are manual. BMAD Method is brilliant but every artifact is handcrafted. SpecKit is simple but just templates. Both require constant manual sync.

SpecWeave automates it:
- Hooks fire after every task → docs sync automatically
- Plugin system → load only what you need (76% context reduction)
- Quality gates → enforce completion before closing increments
- Brownfield support → gradual migration from messy codebases

Video demo (28 min):
- 5 greenfield projects (stocks, blockchain, AI, e-commerce, DevOps)
- 1 brownfield migration (EasyChamp: zero docs → full specs)
- Comparison: BMAD vs SpecKit vs SpecWeave (timestamp 24:00)

**Hacker News**:
```
Title: SpecWeave: Automated living specs with 76% AI context reduction (open source)

URL: [GitHub repo URL, not YouTube—HN prefers code]

First comment (by you):
"Author here. Built this after struggling with spec-drift on 3 consecutive projects.

Key insight: Specs should be executable infrastructure (like CI/CD), not documentation.

Hooks fire after every task → docs sync automatically. Plugin system loads only relevant context (React app: 12K tokens instead of 50K).

Video demo shows 5 greenfield + 1 brownfield migration.

Happy to answer questions about the architecture."
```

**Timing**: Post at 11 AM EST (after initial YouTube engagement)

---

**Dev.to Article**:
```
Title: "I automated spec-driven development. Here's what I learned."

Body: [Write 2,000-word article covering]:
1. The problem (spec drift, manual sync)
2. Existing solutions (BMAD, SpecKit—why they fall short)
3. The architecture (hooks, plugins, living docs)
4. Technical deep dive (plugin loader, 4-phase detection)
5. Results (76% context reduction, automated sync)
6. Lessons learned (what worked, what didn't)
7. Future roadmap (community plugins, marketplace)

Tags: #opensource #devtools #productivity #specdriven #automation

Embed: YouTube video, diagrams, code snippets

CTA: "Try it on your brownfield project. Share your results."
```

#### 12:00 PM - Engagement Monitoring

**Monitor and respond to**:
1. YouTube comments (reply to ALL in first 4 hours)
2. Twitter mentions (engage with everyone)
3. Reddit threads (answer technical questions)
4. Hacker News (defend controversial takes, admit limitations)

**Response Templates**:

For "This is just BMAD":
```
"BMAD inspired this, but the automation is key. With BMAD, YOU sync docs manually. With SpecWeave, hooks do it automatically after every task. Check timestamp 8:00 for the architecture."
```

For "Seems overengineered":
```
"Fair pushback. If your project is tiny, SpecKit's templates are enough. This is for teams of 5-50 where manual sync fails. The plugin system keeps it lightweight—you only load what you need."
```

For "How is this different from [X]?":
```
"Great question. [X] focuses on [their strength]. SpecWeave's unique combo is: automated hooks + living docs + plugin modularity. Timestamp 24:00 has the full comparison."
```

---

#### 3:00 PM - Influencer Follow-Up

If no response from Den Delimarsky or others by 3 PM, send friendly nudge:

**Twitter**:
```
@denniscode Hey! Saw you're active today. If you get a chance, would love your take on the comparison at 24:00 in the video. No pressure—just respect your work on SpecKit.

### Day 5: Influencer Collaboration

**If Den Delimarsky responded positively**:

**Collaboration idea**:
```
Hey Den,

Glad you liked it! Idea: What if we did a joint video?

"SpecKit vs SpecWeave: When to Use What"

I'll explain why SpecKit's simplicity wins for small teams.
You explain when full automation is overkill.

Honest comparison. No BS. Help devs choose right tool.

Interested? We could record async, I'll edit.
```

**Why this works**:
- Positions as complementary, not competitive
- Both audiences benefit
- Credibility boost for you
- Content for both channels

**If BMAD creator responded**:

**Collaboration idea**:
```
What if we wrote a joint article?

"BMAD Method in 2025: Manual vs Automated"

You explain when manual is better (research-heavy, solo).
I explain when automation wins (teams, velocity).

Honest take on trade-offs. Published on both our platforms.
```

## Failure Scenarios & Pivots

### Scenario 1: Low Initial Engagement (<100 stars Day 1)

**Diagnosis**: Hook not compelling, targeting wrong audience

**Pivot**:
1. **Create controversy**: Post "BMAD is obsolete" hot take
2. **Paid promotion**: $200 Twitter/Reddit ads targeting #DevTools
3. **Direct outreach**: Email 50 tech leads in your network

### Scenario 2: High Views, Low Stars (<2% conversion)

**Diagnosis**: Video entertains, but CTA unclear

**Pivot**:
1. **Pin new comment**: "⭐ Star the repo here: [link]—helps others find it"
2. **Add cards**: YouTube cards at 5 min, 15 min, 25 min → GitHub
3. **Community challenge**: Brownfield Challenge (gets users trying it)

### Scenario 3: GitHub Stars, But No Contributors

**Diagnosis**: Barrier to contribution too high

**Pivot**:
1. **Good first issues**: Label 10 issues "good first issue"
2. **Contribution guide**: Write CONTRIBUTING.md with clear steps
3. **Plugin bounty**: $500 prize for first community plugin

### Scenario 4: Influencers Ignore You

**Diagnosis**: Pitch not compelling, or too promotional

**Pivot**:
1. **Genuine help**: Contribute to their projects first (goodwill)
2. **Better hook**: "I automated your methodology—feedback?" (BMAD creator)
3. **Controversy**: Tag them in debate (respectful, data-backed)

## Email Outreach Templates

### For Tech Leads in Your Network

**Subject**: I built something you'll hate (or love)

**Body**:
```
Hey [Name],

Remember that conversation we had about specs always being outdated?

I spent 6 months building a solution. It's called SpecWeave.

**The pitch**: Specs as executable infrastructure. Hooks fire after every task → docs sync automatically.

**Why you'd care**:
- Your team of [size] probably struggles with spec drift
- 76% less AI context (more room for actual code)
- Brownfield support (migrate existing projects gradually)

Honest feedback welcome. If it sucks, tell me why.

### For Podcast Hosts

**Subject**: Guest pitch: "Why your docs are lies (and how to fix it)"

**Body**:
```
Hi [Host],

I'm Anton, creator of SpecWeave—an open-source framework with 1K GitHub stars in its first week.

**The hook**: Most documentation is lies. It's outdated the day you write it. SpecWeave makes docs self-updating via automated hooks.

**Episode angle**: "Automated living documentation: Hype or game-changer?"

**What we'd cover**:
- Why spec-driven development fails (manual sync)
- How automation fixes it (hooks, plugins, quality gates)
- When NOT to use it (over-engineering vs right-sizing)
- Future: AI-generated specs (trust but verify)

**Why your audience cares**:
- Universal problem (every dev has outdated docs)
- Practical solution (open source, use today)
- Controversial (automation vs manual control)

Best,
Anton
