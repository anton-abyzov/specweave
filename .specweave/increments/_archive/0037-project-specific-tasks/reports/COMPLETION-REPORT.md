# Increment 0037: Strategic Init & Project-Specific Architecture

**Date**: 2025-11-16
**Status**: ✅ SPECIFICATION COMPLETE
**Scope**: COMBINED - Phase 0 (Research-Driven Init) + Phase 1-4 (Project Tasks)

---

## Executive Summary

Increment 0037 has been **successfully expanded** to combine two transformational features:

1. **Phase 0: Research-Driven Init** (NEW!)
   - Transform `specweave init` into strategic planning session
   - AI-powered vision analysis and market research
   - Compliance standards detection (30+ standards)
   - Ultra-smart team recommendations (beyond backend/frontend)
   - Architecture decision engine (serverless vs traditional)

2. **Phase 1-4: Project-Specific Tasks** (Existing)
   - Three-level task hierarchy (Increment → Project → User Story)
   - Bidirectional completion tracking
   - Copy-based sync paradigm (enabled by Phase 0)
   - GitHub integration with project-specific progress

**Key Paradigm**: Research insights determine architecture → Architecture determines projects → Projects known from day 1 → Copy-based sync (no transformation)

## Key Paradigm Shift

**OLD Approach** (WRONG):
```
1. Ask technical questions (repositories, projects)
2. Suggest architecture (generic)
3. User builds product
```

**NEW Approach** (CORRECT - Research-Driven):
```
1. Research FIRST (vision, market, scaling goals)
   → Insights: Viral potential? Enterprise customers? Budget constraints?

2. Use insights to suggest architecture
   → Viral potential → Serverless (auto-scales to 1M users)
   → Enterprise → Compliance-ready (HIPAA, SOC2)
   → Budget constrained → Free tier only (Supabase, Vercel)

3. User builds RIGHT architecture from day 1
```

**Key Insight**: **Research findings determine architecture, not the other way around!**
