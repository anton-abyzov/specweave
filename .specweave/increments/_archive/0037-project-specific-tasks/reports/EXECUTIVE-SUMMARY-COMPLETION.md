## What You Asked For

> "No, combine all in one big increment 0037 !!!, 0038 is for another thing! make sure research is also a part of questions to a user and based on it, you could get insights on how to provision and suggest architecture, how to scale product, if there is a vision is also a great part of onboarding for a user on specweave init! ultrathink to complete the job!!"

---

## Key Paradigm Shift

**OLD Approach** (WRONG):
```
Ask questions → Suggest architecture → Build
```

**NEW Approach** (CORRECT):
```
Research vision/market → Insights → Perfect architecture → Build
```

**Example**:
```
User: "We want to be the Figma of project management"

AI Analysis:
→ "Figma" = viral potential, freemium model
→ Project management = competitive market
→ Success = 1M+ users needed

Architecture Recommendation:
→ Serverless (AWS Lambda - auto-scales to 1M users)
→ CDN (CloudFront - global performance)
→ Free tier focus (minimize burn rate)
→ Cost per user: $0.02 (vs $1 for traditional servers!)

Result: PERFECT MATCH FROM DAY 1
```

4. Generate detailed tasks (tasks.md with embedded tests)
5. Begin implementation (Phase 0 or Phase 1-4 first)

**Option 2: Refine Scope**
1. Review spec.md and research documents
2. Provide feedback on what to adjust
3. Iterate on specification

**Option 3: Split into Separate Increments**
1. Increment 0037: Phase 0 (Strategic Init) only
2. Increment 0038: Phase 1-4 (Project Tasks) only
