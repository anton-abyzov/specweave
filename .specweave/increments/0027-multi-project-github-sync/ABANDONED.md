# Increment 0027: Multi-Project GitHub Sync - ABANDONED

**Status**: Abandoned
**Date**: 2025-11-11
**Reason**: Incomplete implementation (no tasks.md), superseded by increment 0028 multi-repo UX improvements

## Why Abandoned

This increment was started but has no tasks.md file. Only contains an implementation report without actual task tracking.

The work may be revisited in a future increment if needed, but for now we're focusing on higher-priority UX improvements to the multi-repo setup flow.

## Next Steps

Continue with increment 0028 for multi-repo UX improvements.
