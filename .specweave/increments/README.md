# Product Increments

Source of truth for all SpecWeave product increments (user stories, tasks, and plans).

## Structure

Each increment follows this structure:

```
###-increment-name/
├── spec.md                  # User stories, acceptance tests (WHAT + WHY)
├── tasks.md                 # Implementation details (HOW + STEPS - ALL technical details)
├── pm-analysis.md           # Optional: From PM agent (product strategy)
├── architecture.md          # Optional: From Architect agent (system design)
├── test-strategy.md         # Optional: From QA agent (testing approach)
├── infrastructure.md        # Optional: From DevOps agent (deployment)
└── security.md              # Optional: From Security agent (security review)
```

**Key principles**:
- **NO plan.md** - Technical details go directly in `tasks.md`
- **NO tests.md** - Acceptance tests in `spec.md`, test strategy in `test-strategy.md` (if needed)
- **NO context-manifest.yaml** - Context loading configured at project level
- **Strategic outputs** - Optional files generated by role-based agents (PM, Architect, QA, DevOps, Security)

## Types of Increments

Increments can represent different types of work. All types follow the same structure (spec.md + tasks.md) but differ in their purpose and scope.

### Feature Increments (Primary)
- **Purpose**: New capabilities and functionality
- **Content**: User stories with acceptance criteria
- **Focus**: Adding value to the product
- **Example**: "Add payment processing", "User authentication system"

### Bug Fix Increments
Bug fixes ARE product increments when they restore or improve product value:

- **Critical/Security bugs** → Dedicated increment (P1)
  - Security vulnerabilities
  - Data integrity issues
  - User-blocking failures
  - Example: `005-payment-security-fix`

- **Major bugs** → Dedicated increment (P1/P2)
  - Significant functionality broken
  - Performance degradation
  - User experience impact
  - Example: `008-checkout-flow-restoration`

- **Minor bugs** → Tasks within current increment
  - Small UI glitches discovered during implementation
  - Edge case handling
  - Polish and refinements
  - These are validation phase tasks, not separate increments

**Bug fix spec.md includes**:
- Description of incorrect behavior (current state)
- Expected correct behavior (desired state)
- Acceptance tests proving the fix works
- Regression tests to prevent recurrence

### Maintenance Increments
- **Purpose**: Improve code quality without changing functionality
- **Content**: Technical debt reduction, refactoring, performance optimization
- **Focus**: Developer experience, system health, scalability
- **Example**: "Refactor authentication layer", "Optimize database queries"

### Documentation Increments
- **Purpose**: Improve project documentation
- **Content**: User guides, API docs, architecture diagrams
- **Focus**: Knowledge transfer, onboarding, clarity
- **Example**: "Complete API documentation", "Migration guide from v1 to v2"

**All increment types use the same structure** but emphasize different aspects in their spec.md and tasks.md files.

## Creating an Increment

### Using CLI (Recommended)
```bash
specweave increment create "Add payment processing"
```

This will:
1. Auto-number the increment (e.g., `003-payment-processing`)
2. Create directory structure
3. Generate spec.md template
4. Create tasks.md template

### Manual Creation
1. Find highest number in `.specweave/increments/` directory
2. Increment by 1
3. Create directory: `.specweave/increments/####-short-name/`
4. Create `spec.md` with frontmatter:
```yaml
---
increment: ####-short-name
title: "Increment Title"
type: feature|bug-fix|maintenance|documentation  # Optional: categorize increment
priority: P1/P2/P3
status: planned/in-progress/completed
created: YYYY-MM-DD
dependencies:
  - 001-skills-framework  # Optional: list dependencies
structure: user-stories
---
```
5. Create `tasks.md` with implementation details

## Increment Lifecycle (5 Stages)

**Status progression**:
```
backlog → planned → in-progress → completed → closed
```

### 1. Backlog (status: backlog)
- **Location**: `.specweave/increments/_backlog/####-name.md`
- **Purpose**: Capture ideas before full planning
- **Criteria**: Basic idea documented
- **Next**: Promote to "planned" when prioritized

### 2. Planned (status: planned)
- **Location**: `.specweave/increments/####-name/`
- **Purpose**: Ready to start, spec complete
- **Criteria**:
  - ✅ `spec.md` created with user stories
  - ✅ `tasks.md` created with implementation plan
  - ✅ Dependencies identified
  - ✅ Priority assigned (P1/P2/P3)
- **Next**: Start with `/start-increment <id>` (checks WIP limit)

### 3. In Progress (status: in-progress)
- **Purpose**: Active development underway
- **Criteria**:
  - ✅ At least 1 task started
  - ✅ WIP limit not exceeded (2-3 max for framework, 1-2 for user projects)
  - ✅ Dependencies completed
- **Activities**:
  - Follow `tasks.md` checklist
  - Mark tasks complete: `[ ]` → `[x]`
  - Add tasks as discovered: `/add-tasks <id> "description"`
  - Log progress in `logs/execution.log`
- **Next**: Complete all P1 tasks

### 4. Completed (status: completed)
- **Purpose**: All P1 tasks done, ready for review
- **Criteria**:
  - ✅ All P1 (critical) tasks completed
  - ✅ All tests passing
  - ✅ Documentation updated
  - ❌ P2/P3 tasks MAY remain (can transfer to another increment)
- **Next**: Close with `/close-increment <id>`

### 5. Closed (status: closed)
- **Purpose**: Reviewed, archived, WIP slot freed
- **Criteria**:
  - ✅ All "completed" criteria met
  - ✅ Closure report generated
  - ✅ Leftovers transferred (if any)
  - ✅ Retrospective done (optional)
- **Result**: WIP slot freed, can start new increment

## WIP (Work In Progress) Limits

**Purpose**: Prevent context-switching (20-40% productivity loss), improve focus and quality

| Project Type | WIP Limit |
|--------------|-----------|
| Framework development (SpecWeave repo) | 2-3 in progress |
| User projects (solo/small team) | 1-2 in progress |
| User projects (large team) | 3-5 in progress |

**Enforcement**:
- Cannot create or start new increment when at WIP limit
- Must close existing increment to free WIP slot
- Override with `--force` (use sparingly)

**Check WIP status**: `/list-increments --wip-only`

## Closing Increments with Leftover Transfer

**When to close** ✅:
- All P1 (critical) tasks completed
- All tests passing
- Documentation updated
- P2/P3 tasks can remain and be transferred

**Valid reasons to transfer leftovers**:
1. Time-boxed completion (e.g., 2-week sprint ended, 80% is enough)
2. Lower priority work (P2/P3 can wait)
3. Scope clarification (some tasks no longer relevant)
4. Blocked tasks (waiting on external dependencies)
5. Business pivot (priorities changed)

**Closure workflow**:
```bash
/close-increment 001

# System validates P1 completion
# Identifies leftovers (P2/P3 tasks)
# Offers transfer options:
#   A) Create new increment with leftovers
#   B) Add to existing increment
#   C) Cancel leftovers
# Generates closure report
# Updates status to "closed"
# Frees WIP slot
```

**Closure report**: Auto-generated in `reports/closure-report.md`

**Task status markers**:
- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[-]` - In progress (optional)
- `[x]` - Completed
- `[T]` - Transferred to another increment
- `[C]` - Canceled (no longer relevant)

## Priority Levels

Increments use P1/P2/P3 prioritization:

- **P1 (Critical)**: Must-have for MVP, blocking other work, foundational capabilities
- **P2 (Important)**: Enhanced functionality, high value, significant features
- **P3 (Nice-to-have)**: Polish, optimizations, future enhancements

## Dependencies

Increments can declare dependencies on other increments:

```yaml
---
increment: 002-role-based-agents
dependencies:
  - 001-skills-framework  # Must complete before this increment
---
```

**Dependency order**: Implement in numerical order unless dependencies allow parallel work

## Current Increments

**IMPORTANT**: This is the SpecWeave framework repository. It has ONE increment representing framework development:

| # | Increment | Priority | Status | Description | Dependencies |
|---|-----------|----------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| [001](./001-core-framework/) | core-framework | P1 | In Progress | Complete SpecWeave framework with 20 agents, 24 skills, context loading, routing, hooks, slash commands. All agents/skills live in `src/`. | None |

**Note**: When you USE SpecWeave in YOUR projects, you'll create many increments (authentication, payments, calendar, etc.). This directory shows how to build the framework itself.

## History: Restructured from Old Features Folder

**NOTE**: This `.specweave/increments/` directory is the current structure (previously called `features/`).

**Current structure** (`.specweave/increments/`):
- ✅ .specweave/increments/####-name/ with spec.md, tasks.md (+ optional strategic outputs)
- ✅ Logs/scripts/reports inside each increment folder (increment-centric)
- ✅ Strategic outputs from agents (pm-analysis.md, architecture.md, etc.)
- ✅ Context loading at project level (no per-increment manifests)

**Simplified from old structure**:
- **NO plan.md** - Tech details go in tasks.md (no redundancy)
- **NO tests.md** - Acceptance tests in spec.md, test strategy in test-strategy.md (if needed)
- **NO context-manifest.yaml** - Context loading is project-level configuration
- **NO global logs/work folders** - Everything lives in increment folders

---

## Best Practices

1. **Keep spec.md technology-agnostic** - Focus on WHAT and WHY (user value), not HOW (implementation)
2. **Put ALL technical details in tasks.md** - No separate plan.md needed
3. **Make tasks executable** - Each task should be independently achievable with clear acceptance criteria
4. **Use role-based agents** - Let PM agent define product strategy, Architect agent design system, etc.
5. **Track dependencies** - Declare dependencies to ensure proper implementation order
6. **Update status** - Keep frontmatter status current (planned → in-progress → completed)
7. **Choose the right increment type**:
   - Critical bugs deserve dedicated increments (with regression tests)
   - Minor bugs are validation tasks within current work
   - Maintenance work improves code without changing behavior
   - Group related fixes/improvements when appropriate
8. **Bug fix increments must include**:
   - Clear description of incorrect behavior
   - Regression tests to prevent recurrence
   - Validation that fix doesn't break other functionality
