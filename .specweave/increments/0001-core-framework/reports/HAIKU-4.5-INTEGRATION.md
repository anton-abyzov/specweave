# Haiku 4.5 Integration - Ultra-Conservative Approach

**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Decision**: Switch **docs-writer agent ONLY** to Haiku 4.5
**Status**: Implemented

---

## Context

Claude Haiku 4.5 offers significant performance improvements:
- ⚡ **4-5x FASTER** than Sonnet 4.5
- 💰 **1/3 the COST** ($1/$5 vs $3/$15 per million tokens)
- 🎯 **90% performance** of Sonnet 4.5
- ✅ **Ideal for**: Template-driven outputs, structured data, agentic workflows

**Question**: Which SpecWeave agents can safely use Haiku 4.5 without quality loss?

## Agent Complexity Analysis

| Agent | Primary Work | Complexity | Decision |
|-------|--------------|------------|----------|
| **PM** | Requirements extraction, prioritization | HIGH - Strategic decisions | ❌ Keep Sonnet |
| **Architect** | Tech stack decisions, ADRs | HIGH - Critical tech choices | ❌ Keep Sonnet |
| **QA Lead** | Test strategy, coverage decisions | MEDIUM - Judgment needed | ⏸️ Wait & test |
| **DevOps** | Infrastructure, deployment platform | HIGH - Critical infrastructure | ❌ Keep Sonnet |
| **Security** | Threat modeling, compliance | VERY HIGH - Security critical | ❌ Keep Sonnet |
| **Tech Lead** | tasks.md generation | LOW - Mechanical extraction | ⏸️ Wait & test |
| **Docs Writer** | API docs, changelog, markdown | LOW - Pure template work | ✅ **SWITCH** |
| **Implementation** | Code generation, debugging | HIGH - Code quality matters | ❌ Keep Sonnet |

## Decision: Docs Writer ONLY (Ultra-Conservative)

### Why Docs Writer is the SAFEST Choice

**Zero Strategic Decisions**:
- ✅ Formats existing content (no creation from scratch)
- ✅ Follows strict markdown templates
- ✅ Extracts info from specs/code (no interpretation)
- ✅ Generates changelog entries (structured format)
- ✅ Creates API reference docs (template-driven)

**Low Risk**:
- ✅ Incorrect docs are easy to spot
- ✅ Docs don't affect runtime behavior
- ✅ Can be regenerated if wrong
- ✅ Template-based work (Haiku 4.5's strength)

**High Benefit**:
- ⚡ 4-5x faster documentation generation
- 💰 67% cost reduction for docs work
- 🎯 Same quality for structured outputs

### What Docs Writer Does

1. **API Documentation** - From code/specs → markdown reference
2. **Changelog Entries** - From completed features → structured changelog
3. **User Guides** - From specs → step-by-step tutorials
4. **Reference Docs** - From code comments → formatted docs
5. **README Updates** - From project changes → updated README

**All template-driven, zero strategic decisions.**

---

## Phase 2: Consider After Testing

If Docs Writer performs well with Haiku 4.5 (same quality, faster), consider:

### QA Lead Agent (Test Strategy)
**Pros**:
- Test strategy follows templates
- Coverage matrix is structured
- TC-ID mapping is mechanical

**Cons**:
- Choosing WHICH tests requires judgment
- Test prioritization needs understanding complexity
- "Do we need E2E?" requires strategic thinking

**Decision**: ⏸️ **WAIT** - Validate Docs Writer first, then test QA Lead

### Tech Lead (tasks.md generation only)
**Pros**:
- tasks.md is mechanical extraction from plan.md
- Just breaks phases into tasks
- No strategic decisions

**Cons**:
- tasks.md structure matters for implementation
- Need to validate quality first

**Decision**: ⏸️ **WAIT** - Validate Docs Writer first, then test Tech Lead

---

## NEVER SWITCH (Too Critical)

These agents require **strategic reasoning** that we CANNOT risk with Haiku 4.5:

1. ❌ **PM Agent** - Product strategy, RICE prioritization (judgment needed)
2. ❌ **Architect Agent** - Technology choices, ADR consequences (expertise needed)
3. ❌ **Security Agent** - Security decisions too critical
4. ❌ **DevOps Agent** - Infrastructure cost/performance trade-offs
5. ❌ **Implementation Agents** - Code quality is critical
6. ❌ **Increment Planner Skill** - Orchestration logic, routing decisions
7. ❌ **Skill Router** - 90% → 81% routing accuracy would hurt UX

**Rule**: If it requires **strategic decisions** or **critical expertise**, keep Sonnet 4.5.

## Implementation

### Changed Files

**src/agents/docs-writer/AGENT.md**:
```yaml
---
name: docs-writer
model: claude-haiku-4-5-20251001  # ← Changed from: model: sonnet
---
```

**Installed to**: `.claude/agents/docs-writer/AGENT.md`

**IMPORTANT**: Using full model identifier `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (NOT just `haiku`) to ensure we're using Haiku 4.5 specifically, not an older Haiku version.

### Testing Plan

1. **Test Docs Writer with Haiku 4.5**:
   - Generate API documentation from specs
   - Create changelog entries
   - Format markdown reference docs
   - Compare quality to Sonnet 4.5 output

2. **Measure Performance**:
   - Speed: Expect 4-5x faster
   - Cost: Expect ~67% reduction
   - Quality: Expect same quality (90% is enough for docs)

3. **If Successful**:
   - Consider QA Lead next
   - Consider Tech Lead (tasks.md only)
   - Document results

4. **If Quality Issues**:
   - Revert to Sonnet 4.5
   - Document what failed
   - Keep all agents on Sonnet 4.5

---

## Expected Outcomes

### Best Case ✅
- Docs Writer generates same-quality docs 4-5x faster
- 67% cost reduction on documentation work
- Can expand to QA Lead and Tech Lead
- **Total savings**: ~40-50% cost reduction across template work

### Worst Case ❌
- Docs quality drops (formatting errors, missing sections)
- Revert to Sonnet 4.5
- Keep all agents on Sonnet 4.5
- **Zero risk**: Easy to revert, docs don't affect runtime

---

## Rationale

**Why Ultra-Conservative?**
- SpecWeave is a framework that generates code/docs for production systems
- Quality > Speed for strategic decisions
- We can't risk incorrect ADRs, bad tech choices, or security mistakes
- Docs are the ONLY safe place to test Haiku 4.5

**Why Docs Writer First?**
- Pure template work (Haiku 4.5's strength)
- Easy to validate (just read the docs)
- Low risk (docs don't run in production)
- High benefit (4-5x faster docs generation)

**Phased Rollout**:
1. Start with safest (Docs Writer)
2. Validate quality
3. Expand to next safest (QA Lead)
4. Validate again
5. Never expand to critical agents (PM, Architect, Security)

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Switch All Agents to Haiku 4.5
**Pros**: Maximum speed and cost savings
**Cons**: Too risky - strategic decisions might suffer
**Rejected**: Quality > Speed for critical work

### Alternative 2: Hybrid (Sonnet for strategy, Haiku for execution)
**Pros**: Balanced approach, significant savings
**Cons**: Need to validate each agent individually
**Status**: Current plan (start with Docs Writer)

### Alternative 3: Keep All on Sonnet 4.5
**Pros**: Maximum quality guaranteed
**Cons**: Slower, more expensive, no innovation
**Rejected**: We can safely optimize docs work

---

## Success Criteria

**Docs Writer with Haiku 4.5 is successful if**:
- ✅ Same markdown quality as Sonnet 4.5
- ✅ Follows templates correctly
- ✅ No missing sections
- ✅ Proper formatting
- ✅ Accurate content extraction
- ✅ 4-5x faster generation
- ✅ ~67% cost reduction

**If ANY quality issue appears**: Revert immediately.
