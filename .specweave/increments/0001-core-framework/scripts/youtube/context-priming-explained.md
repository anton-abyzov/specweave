# YouTube Script: SpecWeave Context Priming Explained

**Video Title**: "How SpecWeave Achieves 70-96% Token Reduction with Context Priming"

**Duration**: 8-10 minutes

**Target Audience**: Developers, AI engineers, technical architects

**Keywords**: context loading, token reduction, AI development, specification-driven development, SpecWeave

---

## [00:00-00:30] Hook & Problem Statement

**Visual**: Screen recording showing AI loading 85,000 tokens for a simple task

**Script**:

> "What if I told you that your AI is wasting 75% of the context it loads?
>
> You ask it to implement Stripe payments, and it loads EVERYTHING:
> - Your entire spec - all 50,000 tokens
> - All architecture docs - 20,000 tokens
> - All ADRs - 10,000 tokens
> - Plus your CLAUDE.md - 5,000 tokens
>
> **85,000 tokens total.**
>
> But only 20,000 tokens are actually relevant to Stripe integration.
>
> That's a 75% waste.
>
> And it gets worse as your project grows. A 600-page enterprise spec? You're looking at 600,000 tokens - and still only need 20,000.
>
> This is why large projects feel slow, expensive, and produce lower-quality outputs.
>
> But there's a better way."

**Visual Transition**: SpecWeave logo appears

## [00:30-01:30] Introducing SpecWeave Context Priming

**Visual**: Split screen - "Before" (85K tokens) vs "After" (17K tokens)

**Script**:

> "SpecWeave solves this with **Context Priming** - a revolutionary approach that achieves 70-96% token reduction.
>
> Instead of loading everything and hoping the AI figures it out...
>
> We load **exactly what's needed. Nothing more, nothing less.**
>
> Same Stripe integration example:
> - Before: 85,000 tokens
> - After: 17,200 tokens
> - **Reduction: 79.8%**
>
> And here's the magic: The larger your project, the better it gets.
>
> - 50-page spec? 60% reduction
> - 100-page spec? 85% reduction
> - 600-page enterprise spec? **96.7% reduction**
>
> So how does this work?"

## [01:30-03:00] Layer 1: Context Manifests (Declarative Context)

**Visual**: Show context-manifest.yaml file with syntax highlighting

**Script**:

> "The foundation is **Context Manifests** - each feature DECLARES what context it needs upfront.
>
> Here's a manifest for Stripe integration:"

**Visual**: Display manifest file:
```yaml
---
spec_sections:
  - .specweave/docs/internal/strategy/payments/stripe/spec.md
  - .specweave/docs/internal/strategy/payments/shared/payment-entities.md
  - .specweave/docs/internal/strategy/payments/shared/compliance.md#pci-dss

documentation:
  - .specweave/docs/internal/architecture/payments/stripe-integration.md
  - .specweave/docs/internal/architecture/adr/0005-payment-provider.md
  - CLAUDE.md#development-workflow

max_context_tokens: 20000
---
```

**Script continues**:

> "Notice three key features:
>
> **1. File-level precision** - Load specific files, not entire directories
>
> **2. Section-level precision** - That hashtag syntax? `file.md#section-name` loads ONLY that section. Not the entire file.
>
> **3. Token budgeting** - We set a hard limit. No bloat allowed.
>
> This manifest is version-controlled with your feature. It's declarative - it states 'what' context is needed, not 'how' to load it."

---

## [03:00-04:30] Layer 2: Modular Specifications

**Visual**: Show directory tree of modular specs

**Script**:

> "But you can't load selectively if everything is in one giant file.
>
> That's why SpecWeave uses **Modular Specifications**."

**Visual**: Show monolithic spec (500 pages) vs modular structure:
```
.specweave/docs/internal/strategy/
├── payments/
│   ├── stripe/
│   │   ├── spec.md
│   │   ├── api-contracts.md
│   │   └── data-model.md
│   ├── paypal/
│   │   ├── spec.md
│   │   └── webhooks.md
│   └── shared/
│       ├── payment-entities.md
│       └── compliance.md
```

**Script continues**:

> "Instead of one 500-page monolith, we organize by functional modules.
>
> When you work on Stripe integration:
> - ✅ Load `payments/stripe/` - Relevant
> - ❌ Skip `paypal/` - Not needed
> - ✅ Load `shared/` - Needed by both
>
> Each module is self-contained. This scales to 100+ modules without context bloat."

---

## [04:30-06:00] Layer 3: The Context-Loader Engine

**Visual**: Animated flow diagram showing the loading algorithm

**Script**:

> "Now for the engine that makes this work: the **context-loader skill**.
>
> Here's what happens when you say 'Implement Stripe integration':"

**Visual**: Step-by-step animation:

1. **Step 1**: "Read the context manifest"
2. **Step 2**: "Check cache - first load, so cache miss"
3. **Step 3**: "Load specified files and sections"
   - Show progress bar: Loading payments/stripe/spec.md (8,000 tokens)
   - Loading compliance.md#pci-dss (1,500 tokens)
   - Loading CLAUDE.md#development-workflow (500 tokens)
4. **Step 4**: "Enforce token budget - 17,200 / 20,000 tokens used ✅"
5. **Step 5**: "Cache result for 15 minutes"
6. **Step 6**: "Return focused context"

**Script continues**:

> "The magic is in section-level extraction. See that `#pci-dss`?
>
> The loader parses markdown headers, finds the section, and loads ONLY that content.
>
> Not the entire 15-page compliance document. Just the PCI-DSS section you need.
>
> And here's the best part: repeated loads are instant because we cache everything for 15 minutes."

---

## [06:00-07:00] Layer 4: Caching Strategy

**Visual**: Show cache directory structure and hit/miss diagram

**Script**:

> "Speaking of caching, this is where performance gets amplified.
>
> Every loaded context is cached with:
> - A hash of the manifest (detect changes)
> - A 15-minute expiry (auto-refresh)
> - Vector embeddings for semantic search (coming in v2)
>
> When you work on Stripe again 5 minutes later?
>
> **Instant load. Zero tokens used.**
>
> The cache only invalidates when:
> - 15 minutes pass
> - Source files change
> - Manifest is updated
>
> This makes iterative development incredibly fast."

## [07:00-08:00] The Math: Real-World Impact

**Visual**: Animated chart showing scaling analysis

**Script**:

> "Let's look at real numbers across different project sizes:"

**Visual**: Table animates in:

| Project Size | Total Spec | Feature Context | Reduction |
|--------------|------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Small (50 pages) | 50,000 tokens | 20,000 tokens | **60%** |
| Medium (100 pages) | 100,000 tokens | 15,000 tokens | **85%** |
| Large (300 pages) | 300,000 tokens | 20,000 tokens | **93.3%** |
| Enterprise (600 pages) | 600,000 tokens | 20,000 tokens | **96.7%** |

**Script continues**:

> "Notice the pattern? **The bigger your project, the better the reduction.**
>
> At enterprise scale - 600 pages - you're loading just 3.3% of the total context.
>
> That's not just efficiency. That's the difference between possible and impossible.
>
> Without context priming, a 600-page spec hits Claude's 200K token limit. You literally can't load it.
>
> With context priming? 20,000 tokens. Room for implementation, conversations, and iterations."

## [08:00-09:00] Why This Matters

**Visual**: Split screen showing solo dev, team, and enterprise scenarios

**Script**:

> "Why does this matter?
>
> **For solo developers**: Work on large projects without context overwhelm. Faster responses, clearer output.
>
> **For teams**: Each developer loads only their domain. Frontend devs don't see backend specs. No cross-contamination.
>
> **For enterprise**: Make 600-page specifications viable. AI can actually navigate your massive documentation.
>
> And the best part? This is all automatic. You don't manage cache, you don't optimize manifests.
>
> SpecWeave's `feature-planner` skill creates the manifest for you when you describe a feature. The `context-loader` handles the rest."

---

## [09:00-10:00] Closing & Call to Action

**Visual**: SpecWeave logo with links appearing

**Script**:

> "So let's recap:
>
> SpecWeave achieves 70-96% token reduction through:
> 1. **Context Manifests** - Declare exactly what you need
> 2. **Modular Specs** - Break down into loadable modules
> 3. **Smart Loading** - Section-level precision
> 4. **Intelligent Caching** - Instant repeated loads
> 5. **Semantic Search** - Dynamic context expansion (coming soon)
>
> This isn't just optimization. It's a fundamental shift from 'load everything and hope' to '**load exactly what's needed.**'
