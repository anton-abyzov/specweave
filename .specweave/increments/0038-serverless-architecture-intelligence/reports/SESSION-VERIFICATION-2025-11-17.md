The increment is fully implemented, tested, and documented. All 24 tasks are complete, and the deliverables are production-ready.

### Next Steps (for user)
1. ✅ Increment 0038 is complete - no action needed
2. Consider starting next increment: `/specweave:next`
3. Or close this increment: `/specweave:done 0038`
