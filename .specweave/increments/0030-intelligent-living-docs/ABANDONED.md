# Increment 0030: Intelligent Living Docs - ABANDONED

**Status**: Abandoned
**Date**: 2025-11-12
**Reason**: Never fully planned (no spec.md or tasks.md created)

## Why Abandoned

This increment folder was created but planning never completed. Only reports/ folder exists with performance benchmarks and validation reports.

The work may be revisited in a future increment if needed, but for now this increment is considered abandoned.

## Next Steps

If intelligent living docs functionality is needed, create a new increment with proper planning (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md).
