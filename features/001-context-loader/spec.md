# Feature: Context Loader for Selective Specification Loading

## Overview

The Context Loader is a foundational SpecWeave feature that enables **precision context loading** based on context manifests. Instead of loading entire 500-page specifications, it selectively loads only relevant sections, reducing token usage by 70%+ while maintaining full context awareness.

## User Value

### Problem

Traditional spec-driven frameworks load entire specification documents, causing:
- Massive token consumption (50k-100k tokens for large specs)
- Slow response times due to context processing
- Context window exhaustion on complex projects
- Inability to scale to enterprise documentation

### Solution

Context Loader solves this by:
- Loading only sections declared in context manifests
- Using section anchors for granular selection (e.g., `#authentication-flow`)
- Caching frequently accessed specs for performance
- Budgeting token usage per operation
- Enabling enterprise-scale specs without bloat

## User Stories

### US1: Load Specifications via Context Manifest (P1)

**As a** SpecWeave developer
**I want** to declare which spec sections I need in a context manifest
**So that** only relevant documentation is loaded

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Parse `context-manifest.yaml` files
- [ ] Support glob patterns (e.g., `specs/modules/payments/**/*.md`)
- [ ] Support section anchors (e.g., `#authentication-flow`)
- [ ] Load specs, architecture docs, and ADRs
- [ ] Respect `max_context_tokens` budget
- [ ] Fail gracefully if budget exceeded with helpful error

### US2: Cache Frequently Accessed Specs (P1)

**As a** SpecWeave user
**I want** frequently accessed specifications to be cached
**So that** repeated operations are faster and more efficient

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Cache parsed specs in `.specweave/cache/`
- [ ] Invalidate cache when source specs change
- [ ] Support cache warming for common specs
- [ ] Track cache hit/miss rates
- [ ] Provide cache statistics via CLI

### US3: Selective Section Loading (P1)

**As a** feature developer
**I want** to load specific sections of large specs
**So that** I only get relevant content without noise

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Parse markdown section headers
- [ ] Extract content from `#section-name` to next header
- [ ] Support nested sections (e.g., `##`, `###`)
- [ ] Handle multiple sections from same file
- [ ] Preserve markdown formatting

### US4: Context Budget Management (P2)

**As a** SpecWeave architect
**I want** to enforce token budgets on context loading
**So that** we never exceed context windows unexpectedly

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Calculate token count of loaded context
- [ ] Warn when approaching budget (>80%)
- [ ] Fail when budget exceeded with clear message
- [ ] Suggest optimization strategies
- [ ] Report actual vs budgeted tokens

### US5: Context Index Generation (P2)

**As a** SpecWeave user
**I want** an searchable index of all spec sections
**So that** I can discover what context is available

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Scan all specs in `specs/` directory
- [ ] Extract all headers and sections
- [ ] Build searchable index in `.specweave/cache/context-index.json`
- [ ] Support keyword search
- [ ] Auto-refresh on spec changes

## Functional Requirements

### FR-001: Context Manifest Parsing
- Must parse YAML context manifests
- Support glob patterns for file matching
- Support section anchors for granular selection
- Validate manifest structure before loading

### FR-002: Selective Loading
- Load only files/sections declared in manifest
- Support multiple files in single manifest
- Handle missing files gracefully (log warning, continue)
- Preserve markdown structure and formatting

### FR-003: Caching Layer
- Cache parsed specs in `.specweave/cache/`
- Track file modification times for invalidation
- Support cache clear command
- Configurable cache TTL

### FR-004: Token Budget Enforcement
- Calculate tokens using tiktoken or similar
- Compare against `max_context_tokens` in manifest
- Fail fast before sending to AI if over budget
- Provide budget optimization suggestions

### FR-005: Integration with Skills
- Skills can request context via manifest
- Auto-load manifest from feature/issue directory
- Support priority-based loading (high priority first)
- Enable context refresh on demand

## Success Criteria

1. **Performance**: 70%+ reduction in token usage vs loading full specs
2. **Accuracy**: 100% of declared sections loaded correctly
3. **Cache Hit Rate**: >60% for common operations
4. **Budget Compliance**: 0 unexpected context window overflows
5. **Scalability**: Handle 500+ page specs across 100+ modules

## Out of Scope

- Vector search for semantic context loading (future enhancement)
- AI-powered context summarization (may add in v2)
- Multi-language spec support (UTF-8 markdown only for now)
- Context versioning/branching (assumes single source of truth)

## Dependencies

- Markdown parser (remark or marked)
- Token counter (tiktoken or gpt-tokenizer)
- File system utilities (glob, fs-extra)
- YAML parser (js-yaml)
