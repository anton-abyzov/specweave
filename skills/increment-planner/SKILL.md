# Increment Planner Skill

## 📚 Required Reading (LOAD FIRST)

**CRITICAL**: Before planning features, read this guide:
- **[Increment Lifecycle Guide](.specweave/docs/internal/delivery/guides/increment-lifecycle.md)**

This guide contains:
- Complete increment structure (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, tests.md)
- WIP limits and status progression
- Task vs increment decision tree
- Context manifest creation for 70%+ token reduction

**Load this guide using the Read tool BEFORE creating feature plans.**

---

This skill creates comprehensive, well-structured implementation plans for SpecWeave features following the Spec-Driven Development methodology.

## Purpose

The increment-planner skill automates the creation of feature implementation plans, ensuring:
- Auto-numbered feature directories (`0001-9999` 4-digit format)
- Duplicate detection (prevents creating 0002 when 0002 already exists)
- Complete feature artifacts (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, tests.md)
- Proper context manifests for selective loading
- Constitutional compliance
- Separation of WHAT/WHY (spec) from HOW (plan) from STEPS (tasks)

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Creating a new feature from a description
- Planning implementation for a user story
- Organizing work for a complex task
- Breaking down epics into executable features
- Structuring brownfield modifications

## Activation Triggers

This skill activates automatically when users say:
- "Plan a feature for..."
- "Create implementation plan for..."
- "I want to add [feature description]"
- "Help me structure [feature]"
- "Break down this feature: ..."

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Living Documentation Workflow

**MANDATORY**: Feature planner must orchestrate **BOTH** living docs and increment files.

### Correct Workflow (MUST FOLLOW)

```
User: "I want to build real-time price tracking"
    ↓
increment-planner skill
    ↓
STEP 1: Scan existing docs
├─ Read .specweave/docs/internal/strategy/ (existing requirements)
├─ Read .specweave/docs/internal/architecture/adr/ (existing decisions)
└─ Pass existing context to agents
    ↓
STEP 2: Invoke PM Agent (🚨 MANDATORY - USE TASK TOOL)

YOU MUST USE THE TASK TOOL - DO NOT SKIP:

Task(
  subagent_type: "pm",
  description: "PM product strategy",
  prompt: "Create product strategy for: [user feature description]

  Context from existing docs: [summary of strategy docs from Step 1]

  You MUST create BOTH living docs AND increment files:

  1. Living docs (source of truth):
     - Create .specweave/docs/internal/strategy/{module-name}/
       * overview.md (product vision, problem, users)
       * requirements.md (FR-001, NFR-001, technology-agnostic)
       * user-stories.md (US1, US2, US3...)
       * success-criteria.md (KPIs, metrics)

  2. Increment file:
     - Create .specweave/increments/{number}-{name}/spec.md
     - Keep spec.md < 250 lines (summary only)
     - MUST reference living docs
     - Include links to ../../docs/internal/strategy/{module}/

  Tech stack: [detected tech stack]"
)

Wait for PM agent to complete!
    ↓
STEP 3: Invoke Architect Agent (🚨 MANDATORY - USE TASK TOOL)

YOU MUST USE THE TASK TOOL - DO NOT SKIP:

Task(
  subagent_type: "architect",
  description: "Architect technical design",
  prompt: "Create technical architecture for: [user feature description]

  FIRST, read PM's strategy docs from .specweave/docs/internal/strategy/{module}/

  You MUST create BOTH living docs AND increment files:

  1. Living docs (source of truth):
     - Update .specweave/docs/internal/architecture/system-design.md
     - Create .specweave/docs/internal/architecture/adr/ (at least 3 ADRs):
       * ####-websocket-vs-polling.md
       * ####-database-choice.md
       * ####-deployment-platform.md
     - Create diagrams/{module}/ (Mermaid C4 diagrams)
     - Create data-models/{module}-schema.sql

  2. Increment file:
     - Create .specweave/increments/{number}-{name}/plan.md
     - Keep plan.md < 500 lines (summary only)
     - MUST reference living docs
     - Include links to ../../docs/internal/architecture/adr/

  Tech stack: [detected tech stack]"
)

Wait for Architect agent to complete!
    ↓
STEP 4: Validate Living Docs
├─ Check .specweave/docs/internal/strategy/{module}/ is NOT empty
├─ Check .specweave/docs/internal/architecture/adr/ has ≥3 ADRs
├─ Check increment spec.md REFERENCES (not duplicates) strategy docs
└─ Check increment plan.md REFERENCES (not duplicates) architecture docs
    ↓
✅ SUCCESS: Living docs updated, increment created
```

### Validation Rules (MANDATORY)

Before completing feature planning, verify:

**Living Docs Created**:
- [ ] `.specweave/docs/internal/strategy/{module}/requirements.md` exists
- [ ] `.specweave/docs/internal/architecture/adr/` has ≥3 ADRs
- [ ] `requirements.md` is technology-agnostic (no PostgreSQL, WebSocket, etc.)
- [ ] ADRs follow template (Context, Decision, Alternatives, Consequences)

**Increment Files Reference Living Docs**:
- [ ] `spec.md` has links to `../../docs/internal/strategy/{module}/`
- [ ] `plan.md` has links to `../../docs/internal/architecture/adr/`
- [ ] `spec.md` is < 250 lines (summary only)
- [ ] `plan.md` is < 500 lines (summary only)

**Agents Followed Process**:
- [ ] PM Agent scanned existing strategy docs before creating new ones
- [ ] Architect Agent read PM's strategy docs before creating architecture
- [ ] Architect created ADRs for ALL technical decisions

---

## Feature Planning Process

### Step 1: Analyze Feature Description

When a user provides a feature description:

1. **Extract Requirements**:
   - What is the core user value?
   - Why is this feature needed?
   - What problem does it solve?

2. **Identify Scope**:
   - What functionality is included?
   - What is explicitly excluded?
   - Are there dependencies?

3. **Determine Priority**:
   - P1 (Critical): Must-have for MVP
   - P2 (Important): High-value enhancement
   - P3 (Nice-to-have): Polish and optimization

### Step 2: Generate Short Name

From feature description, create a short name following these rules:

1. **Extract Keywords**:
   - Remove stop words (the, a, an, for, with, etc.)
   - Identify 2-4 most meaningful words
   - Use action-noun format where possible

2. **Format**:
   - Lowercase
   - Hyphen-separated
   - Max 50 characters
   - Example: `stripe-payment-integration` from "Integrate Stripe payment processing"

3. **Validate**:
   - Check for existing features with similar names
   - Ensure uniqueness
   - Avoid abbreviations unless well-known

### Step 3: Auto-Number Feature

Determine the next feature number:

1. **Scan Existing**:
   - Read `.specweave/increments/` directory
   - Extract all `0001-9999` prefixes (4-digit format)
   - Also check legacy `001-999` formats (3-digit) to prevent conflicts
   - Find highest number

2. **Increment**:
   - Add 1 to highest number
   - Zero-pad to 4 digits (e.g., 0001, 0002, ..., 0010, 0011, ..., 0999, 1000, ..., 9999)

3. **Duplicate Detection**:
   - Check if increment number already exists
   - Throw error if duplicate found (prevents creating 0002 when 0002 exists)
   - This prevents the naming conflict shown in the image where two 0002-* increments existed

4. **Create Path**:
   - Format: `.specweave/increments/0001-short-name/`
   - Example: `.specweave/increments/0003-stripe-payment-integration/`

### Step 4: Create Feature Structure

Generate the complete feature directory with all required files:

```
.specweave/increments/####-short-name/
├── spec.md                 # Feature specification (WHAT and WHY)
├── plan.md                 # Implementation plan (HOW)
├── tasks.md                # Executable tasks (STEPS)
├── tests.md                # Test strategy and cases
└── context-manifest.yaml   # Context loading specification
```

### Step 5: Generate spec.md

**Purpose**: Define WHAT this feature does and WHY it's needed.

**Structure**:
```yaml
---
feature: 0001-short-name
title: "Human-Readable Feature Title"
priority: P1 | P2 | P3
status: planned
created: YYYY-MM-DD
---

```

**Key Principles**:
- Technology-agnostic (no HOW, only WHAT and WHY)
- Focused on user value
- Measurable acceptance criteria
- Prioritized user stories (P1/P2/P3)

### Step 6: Generate plan.md

**Purpose**: Define HOW to implement the feature technically.

**Structure**:
```markdown
# Implementation Plan: [Feature Title]

## Overview
[Technical summary of implementation approach]

```

**Key Principles**:
- Technology-specific (HOW to build it)
- Architectural decisions documented
- Challenges and solutions identified
- Constitutional compliance checked

### Step 7: Generate tasks.md

**Purpose**: Break down implementation into executable steps with intelligent model selection.

**CRITICAL**: Use the model detection utility to assign optimal models to tasks:
```typescript
import { detectModelForTask, formatModelHint } from '../utils/model-selection';
```

**Structure**:
```markdown
# Tasks: [Feature Title]

## Task Notation

- `[T###]`: Sequential task ID
- `[P]`: Parallelizable (no file conflicts)
- `[US#]`: User story reference
- `[ ]`: Not started
- `[x]`: Completed
- Model hints: ⚡ haiku (fast), 🧠 sonnet (thinking), 💎 opus (critical)

## Phase 1: Setup and Foundation

- [ ] [T001] [P] ⚡ haiku - Initialize project structure
- [ ] [T002] [P] ⚡ haiku - Setup testing framework
- [ ] [T003] ⚡ haiku - Install dependencies

## Phase 2: Core Implementation

### US1: [User Story Title] (P1)

- [ ] [T004] ⚡ haiku - Write test for [component]
- [ ] [T005] ⚡ haiku - Implement [component] in src/path/file.ts
- [ ] [T006] [P] ⚡ haiku - Create [another component]
- [ ] [T007] 🧠 sonnet - Integrate components (requires decision-making)
- [ ] [T008] ⚡ haiku - Verify US1 acceptance criteria

### US2: [User Story Title] (P2)

- [ ] [T009] ⚡ haiku - Write test for [feature]
- [ ] [T010] 🧠 sonnet - Implement [feature] (complex logic)
...

## Phase 3: Testing and Validation

- [ ] [T050] Run integration tests
- [ ] [T051] Performance testing
- [ ] [T052] Security review
- [ ] [T053] Documentation update

## Phase 4: Deployment

- [ ] [T060] Prepare deployment scripts
- [ ] [T061] Staging deployment
- [ ] [T062] Production deployment

## Dependencies

T005 depends on T004 (test must exist first)
T007 depends on T005, T006 (components must exist)
T051 depends on T050 (integration must pass first)
```

**Key Principles**:
- Story-centric organization (not layer-centric)
- Test-first sequence (tests before implementation)
- Exact file paths specified
- Parallelizable tasks marked `[P]`
- Dependencies explicitly stated
- **Model hints for cost optimization**: Each task labeled with optimal model
  - ⚡ haiku: Clear instructions, mechanical work (3x faster, 20x cheaper)
  - 🧠 sonnet: Complex decisions, creative problem-solving
  - 💎 opus: Critical architecture (rare, use sparingly)

**Model Selection Guidelines**:
1. **Use Haiku (⚡) when**:
   - Task has specific file path (e.g., `src/components/LoginForm.tsx`)
   - Acceptance criteria are detailed (3+ specific points)
   - Implementation approach is defined in plan.md
   - Simple CRUD operations, configuration, setup tasks

2. **Use Sonnet (🧠) when**:
   - Task requires architecture decisions
   - Multiple valid approaches exist
   - Integration between components
   - Complex business logic
   - Error handling strategies

3. **Use Opus (💎) when**:
   - Critical system architecture
   - Security-critical decisions
   - Performance-critical algorithms
   - Novel problem-solving required

### Step 8: Generate tests.md

**Purpose**: Define comprehensive testing strategy and test cases.

**Structure**:
```markdown
# Test Strategy: [Feature Title]

## Test Philosophy

Follow SpecWeave Constitution Article III: Test-First Development
- Tests written before implementation
- Tests must fail initially (red-green-refactor)
- Integration tests with real environments

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
[Component-level tests]

### Integration Tests
[Module integration tests]

### E2E Tests
[End-to-end user flows]

### Performance Tests
[Load, stress, scalability tests]

## Test Cases

### TC-001: [Test Name]
**Type**: Unit | Integration | E2E
**Priority**: P1 | P2 | P3
**User Story**: US1

**Scenario**:
- Given [precondition]
- When [action]
- Then [expected outcome]

**Test Data**:
[Sample inputs]

**Expected Results**:
[Specific, measurable outcomes]

### TC-002: [Test Name]
...

## Test Coverage Targets

- Unit test coverage: >80%
- Integration test coverage: Critical paths
- E2E coverage: All P1 user stories

## Testing Tools

- Unit: [Framework]
- Integration: [Framework]
- E2E: [Framework]

## Test Environments

- Local: [Setup]
- CI/CD: [Pipeline]
- Staging: [Environment]

## Regression Testing

For brownfield modifications:
1. Document existing behavior
2. Create tests for current functionality
3. User validation of tests
4. Implement changes
5. Verify regression tests still pass

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All P1 tests passing
- [ ] Coverage targets met
- [ ] Performance tests pass
- [ ] No regressions detected
```

**Key Principles**:
- Test-first philosophy
- Comprehensive coverage (unit, integration, E2E)
- Clear test cases with Given-When-Then
- Regression prevention for brownfield
- Measurable success criteria

### Step 9: Generate context-manifest.yaml

**Purpose**: Declare exactly what specifications, architecture docs, and ADRs are needed for this feature.

**Structure**:
```yaml
---
# Context Manifest for Feature: 0001-short-name

# Specification sections to load
spec_sections:
  - specs/modules/[relevant-module]/**/*.md
  - specs/constitution.md#[relevant-article]
  - specs/overview.md

# Architecture documents to load
architecture:
  - architecture/system-design.md#[relevant-section]
  - architecture/data/database-schema.md#[relevant-tables]
  - architecture/[component]/[relevant-doc].md

# Architecture Decision Records to reference
adrs:
  - adrs/0001-[relevant-decision].md

# Context budget (max tokens to load)
max_context_tokens: 10000

# Priority level
priority: high | medium | low

# Auto-refresh context on spec changes
auto_refresh: false

# Related features
related_features:
  - 0001-[other-feature]

# Tags for search and categorization
tags:
  - [category]
  - [domain]
---
```

**Key Principles**:
- Precision loading (only what's needed)
- Section-level granularity (e.g., `#authentication-flow`)
- Token budget to prevent bloat
- Related features for dependency tracking

### Step 10: Validate and Finalize

Before completing:

1. **Constitutional Compliance**:
   - Article V: Modular Scalability (proper structure)
   - Article VI: Separation of Concerns (spec vs plan vs tasks)
   - Article IX: Testing Mandate (tests.md comprehensive)

2. **Quality Checks**:
   - spec.md is technology-agnostic
   - plan.md has sufficient technical detail
   - tasks.md has exact file paths
   - tests.md covers all P1 user stories
   - context-manifest.yaml is precise

3. **Update Features Index**:
   - Add feature to `features/README.md`
   - Update current features list

4. **Notify User**:
   - Feature number and path
   - Next steps (review spec, approve plan)
   - How to start implementation

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Specs

1. **Focus on User Value**:
   - Start with "As a user, I want..."
   - Explain WHY, not just WHAT
   - Measurable success criteria

2. **Prioritize Ruthlessly**:
   - P1: Must-have for MVP
   - P2: Important but not blocking
   - P3: Nice-to-have

3. **Be Specific**:
   - Acceptance criteria are testable
   - Out-of-scope is explicitly defined
   - Dependencies are identified

### Writing Effective Plans

1. **Document Decisions**:
   - Why this technology choice?
   - What alternatives were considered?
   - What are the trade-offs?

2. **Identify Challenges**:
   - Technical risks
   - Complexity areas
   - Mitigation strategies

3. **Show Structure**:
   - File organization
   - Component relationships
   - Integration points

### Writing Effective Tasks

1. **Story-Centric Organization**:
   - Group by user story, not by layer
   - Enables independent implementation
   - Supports incremental delivery

2. **Test-First Sequencing**:
   - Test task before implementation task
   - Enforce TDD workflow
   - Red-green-refactor

3. **Clear Dependencies**:
   - Explicitly state what depends on what
   - Identify parallelizable work
   - Enable concurrent execution

## Example: Creating a Feature

### User Request
"I want to add Stripe payment integration to handle subscriptions"

### Execution

**Step 1**: Analyze
- Core value: Process recurring payments
- Problem: Need subscription billing
- Priority: P1 (required for MVP)

**Step 2**: Short name
- Keywords: stripe, payment, integration
- Format: `stripe-payment-integration`

**Step 3**: Auto-number
- Scan .specweave/increments/: 0001, 0002
- Next: 0003
- Path: `.specweave/increments/0003-stripe-payment-integration/`

**Step 4**: Create structure
```
.specweave/increments/0003-stripe-payment-integration/
├── spec.md
├── plan.md
├── tasks.md
├── tests.md
└── context-manifest.yaml
```

**Step 5**: Generate spec.md
```yaml

# Feature: Stripe Payment Integration

## Overview
Integrate Stripe to handle subscription payments...

## User Stories

### US1: Process Subscription Payment (P1)
As a customer
I want to subscribe to a plan
So that I can access premium features

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Customer can select subscription plan
- [ ] Payment processed via Stripe
- [ ] Subscription activated on success
...
```

**Step 6**: Generate plan.md
```markdown
# Implementation Plan: Stripe Payment Integration

## Technology Decisions
- Stripe SDK: stripe-node v11.x
- Backend: Express.js middleware
- Frontend: Stripe Elements

## Components
- StripeService: Payment processing
- SubscriptionController: API endpoints
- WebhookHandler: Stripe events
...
```

**Step 7**: Generate tasks.md
```markdown
# Tasks: Stripe Payment Integration

## Phase 2: Core Implementation

### US1: Process Subscription Payment (P1)

- [ ] [T001] Write test for StripeService.createSubscription()
- [ ] [T002] Implement StripeService in src/services/stripe-service.ts
- [ ] [T003] [P] Create SubscriptionController in src/controllers/subscription.ts
...
```

**Step 8**: Generate tests.md
```markdown
# Test Strategy: Stripe Payment Integration

## Test Cases

### TC-001: Successful Subscription Creation
Type: Integration
Priority: P1
User Story: US1

Scenario:
- Given a valid customer and plan ID
- When createSubscription() is called
- Then subscription is created in Stripe
- And webhook confirms activation
...
```

**Step 9**: Generate context-manifest.yaml
```yaml
spec_sections:
  - specs/modules/payments/overview.md
  - specs/modules/payments/stripe/spec.md
architecture:
  - architecture/data/database-schema.md#subscriptions
adrs:
  - adrs/005-payment-provider-choice.md
max_context_tokens: 8000
priority: high
```

**Step 10**: Validate
- ✅ spec.md is technology-agnostic
- ✅ plan.md documents Stripe SDK choice
- ✅ tasks.md follows test-first
- ✅ tests.md covers all P1 stories
- ✅ Constitutional compliance verified

**Output**:
```
✅ Feature created: 0003-stripe-payment-integration

Location: .specweave/increments/0003-stripe-payment-integration/
Files created:
- spec.md
- plan.md
- tasks.md
- tests.md
- context-manifest.yaml

Next steps:
1. Review spec.md - verify user stories and acceptance criteria
2. Approve plan.md - validate technical approach
3. Start implementation: specweave implement 0003
```

## Helper Scripts

### `scripts/create-feature.js`

Creates feature directory structure and generates all files.

**Usage**:
```javascript
const featurePlanner = require('./create-feature.js');

const feature = await featurePlanner.createFeature({
  description: "Add Stripe payment integration",
  priority: "P1",
  # Configuration auto-detected
});

console.log(`Created: .specweave/increments/${feature.number}-${feature.shortName}/`);
```

### `scripts/generate-short-name.js`

Generates short names from descriptions.

**Usage**:
```javascript
const { generateShortName } = require('./generate-short-name.js');

const shortName = generateShortName("Integrate Stripe payment processing");
// Returns: "stripe-payment-integration"
```

### `scripts/next-feature-number.js`

Determines next available feature number.

**Usage**:
```javascript
const { getNextFeatureNumber } = require('./feature-utils.js');

const next = getNextFeatureNumber(".specweave/increments/");
// Returns: "0003"
```

## Constitutional Compliance

This skill enforces:

- **Article V**: Modular Scalability - Auto-numbered features prevent conflicts
- **Article VI**: Separation of Concerns - spec vs plan vs tasks are distinct
- **Article IX**: Skill Testing Mandate - tests.md ensures comprehensive testing

## Integration with Other Skills

- **context-loader**: Uses context manifests to load relevant specs
- **spec-author**: Collaborates on specification creation
- **architect**: Collaborates on technical planning
- **developer**: Consumes tasks.md for implementation
- **docs-updater**: Updates features/README.md automatically

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Feature number conflict
**Solution**: The `incrementNumberExists()` function now prevents this by checking for duplicate numbers before creating new increments. If you see this error, use `getNextFeatureNumber()` to get the next available number.

### Issue: Short name too long
**Solution**: Use abbreviations for well-known terms (e.g., auth, api, db)

### Issue: Context manifest too broad
**Solution**: Use section anchors (e.g., `#specific-section`) instead of full files

### Issue: Legacy 3-digit increments (001, 002, 003)
